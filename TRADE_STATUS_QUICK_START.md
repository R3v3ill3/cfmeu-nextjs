# Trade Status Tracking - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

All trade status tracking features have been implemented and are ready for testing.

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Apply Database Migrations

```bash
npx supabase db push
```

This will:
- Add `status`, `status_updated_at`, `status_updated_by` columns to both tables
- Create the `mark_project_complete()` RPC function
- Backfill existing data with 'active' status
- Create performance indexes

### 2. Regenerate TypeScript Types (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --local > src/types/database.ts
```

This eliminates TypeScript warnings about the new status fields.

### 3. Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

Fresh start ensures all changes are loaded.

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Project in Early Works
```
Demo → Status: Completed (already left site)
Piling → Status: Completed (finished)
Scaffold → Status: Active (still on site)
Cleaners → Status: Not Yet Tendered (planning to hire)
```

### Scenario 2: Project Mid-Construction
```
Early Works → Mostly Completed
Structure trades → Active
Finishing trades → Mix of:
  - Tendering (out to tender)
  - Not Yet Tendered (will tender soon)
  - Unknown (not decided yet)
```

### Scenario 3: Project Completion
1. Most trades → Completed
2. A few → Active (defects fixing)
3. Click "Mark Project Complete"
4. → All become Completed

## Keyboard Shortcuts

None currently - all interactions are click-based.

## Mobile Support

- ✅ Status dropdowns work on mobile
- ✅ Filter buttons responsive (stack on small screens)
- ✅ Touch-friendly dropdown menus
- ✅ Horizontal scroll for wide tables

## Data Migration

Existing projects automatically get:
- Status: 'active' (if no end_date or end_date > today)
- Status: 'completed' (if end_date < today)
- Status: 'planned' (if start_date > today)

You can manually adjust any incorrect auto-assignments.

## Troubleshooting

### Status dropdown doesn't appear
**Fix**: 
1. Verify migrations applied: `npx supabase db push`
2. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check console for errors

### "Status update failed" error
**Possible causes**:
1. Not authenticated
2. RLS policy blocking update
3. Invalid status value

**Fix**: Check browser console for detailed error

### Filter counts seem wrong
**Cause**: Null statuses treated as 'active'

**Fix**: This is intentional - null defaults to active

### Bulk complete doesn't work
**Fix**: 
1. Check RPC function exists in database
2. Verify user has permission
3. Check terminal logs for errors

## Support

If issues arise:
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Check terminal logs (where `npm run dev` is running)
3. Check Supabase logs for database errors
4. Reference `TRADE_STATUS_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` for technical details

## What's Next (Optional Future Enhancements)

These are NOT needed for core functionality but could be added later:

1. **Status History**: Track all status changes over time
2. **Notifications**: Alert PMs when trades complete
3. **Dashboard Stats**: Show status breakdown on project cards
4. **Bulk Status Updates**: Change multiple trades at once
5. **Status-Based Reports**: Export by status category
6. **Employer Worksites Details**: Show trade+status for each project
