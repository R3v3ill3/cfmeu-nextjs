# Employer Alias Initiative — Multi-Agent Prompt Pack

This pack provides context-rich prompts for agents contributing to the employer-alias programme inside the `cfmeu-nextjs` monorepo. The project includes:

- Next.js app: `src/`
- Supabase database migrations: `supabase/sql` and `supabase/migrations`
- Background workers (BCI import, EBA/FWC scraping, Incolink sync): `railway_workers/*`

Core documentation worth skimming before any task:

- `EMPLOYER_WORKSITES_FIX.md`
- `PENDING_USER_ACTIVATION_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `BCI_IMPORT_README.md`
- `INCOLINK_IMPORT_README.md`
- `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`

Testing expectations: run relevant unit/integration tests (`pnpm test`, targeted Jest suites, worker-specific tests) plus manual validation of affected flows (e.g., BCI import wizard, Pending Employers queue, Worker import, employer search UI) when applicable. Record findings in task notes.

Each prompt below assumes the agent forks from `main`, confirms migrations run cleanly (`supabase/migrations`), and produces a short validation summary.

## Phase 0 — Alignment & Discovery

### Prompt 0A — Requirement Clarification
- **Goal**: Produce refined acceptance criteria covering alias provenance, canonical-name promotion, and UI requirements.
- **Context**: Review existing docs listed above plus any alias references (e.g., `supabase/sql/migrations/0013_employer_aliases.sql`, `BCIProjectImport.tsx` alias logic).
- **Deliverables**:
  1. Summary of current pain points (alias visibility, canonical inconsistencies, pending workflow gaps).
  2. Acceptance criteria for alias metadata schema, canonical promotion workflow, pending-review UX, and observability.
  3. Open questions or stakeholder clarifications needed.

#### Prompt 0A Findings

**Pain points snapshot**

- Alias provenance is opaque: `employer_aliases` records store only `alias`, `alias_normalized`, `employer_id`, and creator; no source-system trace, timestamps beyond `created_at`, or flags indicating authoritative sources.
- Canonical naming is brittle: stakeholders promote canonical names manually with no audit trail, and the `alias_normalized` unique index prevents storing the same intake alias against multiple employers during triage.
- Pending workflows lack alias context: BCI, Pending Employers, and worker imports cannot surface existing aliases or record the submitted name as an alias when linking to an employer, leading to duplicate employers and lost historical intake labels.
- Observability gaps: there is no logging or telemetry on alias collisions, canonical promotions, or failure to create aliases due to constraints; support teams discover issues only after organiser complaints.

**Acceptance criteria**

- *Alias metadata schema*
  - `public.employer_aliases` includes `source_system`, `source_identifier`, `collected_at`, `collected_by`, `is_authoritative`, and optional `notes`; NULL-safe defaults ensure backfill compatibility.
  - Uniqueness is enforced per employer (`(employer_id, alias_normalized)`), allowing the same normalized alias to exist for multiple employers until merge review completes.
  - Supabase types (`src/types/database.ts`) and any Prisma/TypeScript models expose the new fields; writes/reads require explicit provenance parameters except in administrative backfills.
- *Canonical promotion workflow*
  - Admin UI presents canonical promotion actions with audit logging to a new `employer_canonical_audit` (or equivalent) table containing actor, before/after names, triggering alias, and decision rationale.
  - Promotion requires confirmation that the promoted alias is `is_authoritative = true` or manually confirmed with justification; canonical change updates dependent caches/indexes.
  - System raises an alias conflict event when a promoted alias conflicts with an existing canonical name, offering merge guidance before change commits.
- *Pending-review UX*
  - Pending employer resolution flows display existing aliases, highlight matches to intake name, and capture the final decision (`keep as alias`, `promote to canonical`, `discard`).
  - Any intake employer name saved (even when linking to an existing employer) creates an alias record with provenance and surfaces warnings when another employer already owns that normalized alias.
  - Users can mark aliases as authoritative during intake review, triggering the canonical promotion workflow described above.
- *Observability*
  - Application and worker layers emit structured logs/metrics for alias insertions, conflicts, canonical promotions, and failures (e.g., duplicate constraint violations) with contextual metadata (source system, employer IDs).
  - Dashboard or alerting captures weekly counts of new aliases, conflicts, promotions awaiting review, and failed writes; thresholds trigger notifications to data quality owners.
  - Logs and metrics are traceable back to specific imports or manual actions via `source_identifier`.

**Open questions**

- Should RLS be enabled on `employer_aliases` after introducing provenance, and if so which roles require insert/select access versus mediated RPCs?
- Which teams (organising, data ops, digital) own canonical promotion approvals, and do they need staged approvals or simple audit logging?
- Do background workers require offline-safe normalization utilities, or can they depend on a shared package published from the monorepo?
- For legacy aliases without provenance, is a bulk backfill sufficient, or do we need manual review to mark authoritative sources?
- How should conflicting aliases during intake be surfaced to organisers (blocking modal vs non-blocking alert), and what is the expected SLA on resolving them?

### Prompt 0B — Normalization Audit
- **Goal**: Catalogue every employer-name normalization function across app + workers + SQL, compare behaviour, and recommend a unified spec.
- **Files to inspect**: `src/utils/workerDataProcessor.ts`, `src/utils/fuzzyMatching.ts`, `src/utils/employerMatching.ts`, `src/components/admin/DuplicateEmployerManager.tsx`, `railway_workers/cfmeu-scraper-worker/src/processors/fwc.ts`, relevant SQL merge functions.
- **Deliverables**:
  1. Table of functions (location, behaviour, edge cases).
  2. Recommended canonical normalization rules (string casing, punctuation stripping, suffix handling) plus notes about international/trading-name quirks.
  3. Risks when refactoring (e.g., breaking merge logic, alias conflicts).

#### Prompt 0B Audit

**Normalization inventory**

| Location | Helper(s) | Behaviour summary | Edge cases / gaps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src/utils/workerDataProcessor.ts` | `normalizeCompanyName` | Uppercases, trims, collapses whitespace, standardises `PTY LTD`/`LIMITED`, converts `AND` → `&`, strips non-word characters except ampersand. Used by BCI import to derive `alias_normalized`. | Drops diacritics because `\w` excludes accented characters, keeps corporate suffixes (now always `PTY LTD`), diverges from lower-case implementations elsewhere. |
| `src/utils/fuzzyMatching.ts`, `src/utils/employerMatching.ts` | `normalizeCompanyName` | Lowercases, removes common suffixes (`pty`, `inc`, `llc`), strips filler words (`the`, `and`, `of`), keeps hyphens, removes punctuation, collapses spaces. Powers client/server fuzzy search. | Eliminates connective words entirely (can over-normalize “A & B Electrical”), no diacritic handling, produces lower-case strings that do not match `workerDataProcessor` output. |
| `src/utils/employerDuplication.ts` | `normalizeEmployerName`, `generateSearchVariations` | Lowercases, removes suffix/prefix lists, replaces `&` with `and`, strips punctuation, collapses spaces, then generates variants by reappending suffixes. Used for duplicate detection heuristics. | Converts ampersand differently (`&` → `and`), selective suffix list omits sector words, collisions possible when `and` substitution meets other helpers that prefer `&`. |
| `src/components/admin/DuplicateEmployerManager.tsx` | Local `normalizeCompanyName` | Lowercases, removes suffixes plus sector words (`construction`, `builders`, `contracting`), strips punctuation, collapses spaces. Drives UI duplicate grouping and alias inserts. | Aggressively removes industry descriptors leading to “Acme Construction” → “acme”, increasing false positives; diverges from backend casing/punctuation rules. |
| `railway_workers/cfmeu-scraper-worker/src/processors/fwc.ts` | `simplifyCompanyName`, `extractDistinctKeywords`, `buildQueryCandidates` | Trims trailing corporate words, removes parentheses, filters to first three keywords (>2 chars), builds search permutations without stop words. | Truncates long legal names, omits short-but-meaningful tokens (“HQ”, “JV”), lacks diacritic handling, uses worker-only logic with no TS/SQL parity. |
| `supabase/sql/migrations/0013_employer_aliases.sql`, `supabase/sql/migrations/0017_employer_merge_functions.sql` | Inline `LOWER(REGEXP_REPLACE(...))` | Lowercases and removes non-alphanumeric characters when persisting aliases and during merges; uniqueness enforced on `alias_normalized`. | Leaves multiple spaces, keeps corporate suffixes, strips accented letters entirely, blocks storing the same normalized alias for different employers (pre-0A schema). |

**Recommended canonical normalization spec**

- Adopt a single helper exported to web app, workers, and SQL (`public.normalize_employer_name(text)`) that returns both `normalized` (string) and `tokens` (array) to support search heuristics.
- Pipeline: (1) Unicode NFKD normalize and remove diacritics; (2) trim, convert to uppercase; (3) replace punctuation (`/&+@`) with spaces except convert any `AND`, `&`, `&&` to ` \& `; (4) collapse whitespace; (5) remove trailing corporate suffixes (`PTY`, `PTY LTD`, `LIMITED`, `LTD`, `PROPRIETARY`, `INC`, `INCORPORATED`, `LLC`, `LLP`, `PLC`, `CORP`, `CORPORATION`, `HOLDINGS`, `GROUP`, `ENTERPRISES`, `SERVICES`, `SOLUTIONS`, `TRADING`, `TRUST`, `PTY LIMITED`), while retaining regional qualifiers (`NSW`, `VIC`, `QLD`, `WA`, `SA`, `TAS`, `ACT`, `NZ`); (6) remove leading articles (`THE`, `A`, `AN`) only when more tokens remain; (7) reduce multiple spaces to one. Return `'ACME & SONS'`-style output.
- For trading names (`T/A`, `TRADING AS`, `ATF`, `AS TRUSTEE FOR`), parse and emit additional alias metadata (`source_identifier`, `notes`) so each side of the trading relationship persists as an alias per Prompt 0A, but normalize the stored alias using the same pipeline.
- Preserve numerical identifiers and short tokens (`HQ`, `JV`, `GP`) so regulatory or project-specific suffixes remain searchable; expose token array to keep fuzzy search effective without bespoke stop-word removal.
- Surface normalization config (suffix lists, connector mappings) as data so future international additions (e.g., `GMBH`, `SARL`) can be appended without code changes; version the helper to coordinate web/worker/SQL deployments.
- Ensure the helper respects Prompt 0A’s `(employer_id, alias_normalized)` uniqueness by returning deterministic values and by flagging when normalization collapses distinct inputs (emit structured log for observability).

**Refactor risks & mitigations**

- High — Existing aliases rely on `alias_normalized` unique index (`employer_aliases_alias_normalized_idx`): migrating to `(employer_id, alias_normalized)` plus the new helper requires a staged backfill and conflict report (log per Prompt 0A) before swapping indexes. Mitigation: run dry-run normalization to identify collisions, attach provenance before altering constraints.
- High — BCI importer and duplicate merge SQL currently de-duplicate via `ON CONFLICT (alias_normalized) DO NOTHING`; without refactor these calls will silently drop aliases once helper changes. Mitigation: update insert paths to include provenance + employer scope and assert on unexpected conflict notices.
- Medium — Duplicate detection UIs (`DuplicateEmployerManager`, `employerDuplication`) depend on aggressive word stripping; harmonizing with canonical helper may change grouping sensitivity. Mitigation: introduce regression tests comparing old vs new similarity scores and adjust UI thresholds, leveraging helper’s token output instead of bespoke regex.
- Medium — Worker jobs (FWC scraper, future Incolink alias writes) must bundle the shared helper without increasing bundle size. Mitigation: extract helper into a lightweight ESM module and publish to workers via shared package or codegen snapshot, verifying tree-shaking.
- Low — Search analytics rely on current fuzzy thresholds; normalization changes can shift score distributions. Mitigation: log before/after scores during rollout and recalibrate thresholds with feature flag gating.

## Phase 1 — Core Foundations (sequential)

### Prompt 1A — Shared Normalization Module
- **Prerequisites**: Findings from Prompt 0B approved.
- **Goal**: Implement shared normalization accessible from web app, workers, and SQL.
- **Scope**:
  - Create a TypeScript utility package (e.g., `src/lib/employers/normalize.ts`) exporting deterministic helpers.
  - Add a matching SQL function (`public.normalize_employer_name`) in Supabase migrations.
  - Refactor existing call sites to use the shared helper.
  - Provide unit tests for TS + SQL (e.g., Jest + pgTap or equivalent).
- **Notes**: Coordinate with worker packages (Railway) to avoid bundling issues.

### Prompt 1B — Alias Schema Migration
- **Prerequisites**: Prompt 0A acceptance criteria + Prompt 1A helper ready.
- **Goal**: Extend `public.employer_aliases` with provenance fields and adjust uniqueness.
- **Scope**:
  - Add columns: `source_system text`, `source_identifier text`, `collected_at timestamptz`, `collected_by uuid`, `is_authoritative boolean default false`.
  - Evaluate whether `alias_normalized` uniqueness should become `(alias_normalized, employer_id)` or similar; document decision.
  - Write migration + rollback, backfill script populating metadata for existing entries.
  - Update TypeScript types (`src/types/database.ts`).

#### Prompt 1B Implementation Notes

- Migration `20251014093000_employer_alias_provenance.sql` adds provenance fields (`source_system`, `source_identifier`, `collected_at`, `collected_by`, `is_authoritative`, `notes`) and swaps uniqueness to `employer_aliases_employer_id_alias_normalized_idx` (scope: `employer_id, alias_normalized`).
- Backfill step seeds null provenance with defaults: `source_system = 'legacy_migration'`, `source_identifier = alias`, reused `created_at/created_by`, and annotates notes for audit trace.
- Type definitions in `src/types/database.ts` now expose the new columns for `Row`, `Insert`, and `Update` payloads.
- `collected_at` intentionally allows null to avoid misleading timestamps on legacy data; backfill populates missing values using `created_at`.

### Prompt 1C — Observability & Logging Plan
- **Goal**: Define telemetry hooks for alias conflicts and canonical promotions.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Proposed logging structure (e.g., Supabase function notices, worker logs, Next.js logger).
  - Suggested metrics/dashboards (counts of alias conflicts, pending canonical reviews).
  - Implementation outline for later phases (no code changes required yet, but clarify integration points).

#### Prompt 1C Observability Blueprint

- **Logging contract**
  - *Supabase (SQL + RPC)*: emit `RAISE LOG` payloads via `pg_logical_emit_message` helper capturing `event`, `employer_id`, `alias_id`, `source_system`, `source_identifier`, `normalized`, `is_authoritative`, and `actor_id`. Wrap inserts/updates to `employer_aliases` and canonical promotion RPCs so workers/UI can subscribe via WAL follow or Supabase Functions.
  - *Next.js app*: standardise on `logger.info('alias.conflict', {...})` using existing structured logger, including `userId`, `employerId`, `aliasId`, `alias`, `normalized`, `sourceSystem`, `action`, and `deferredResolution` flag; mirror warning/error levels for retries vs hard failures.
  - *Background workers*: extend Railways’ `logger` to push JSON logs with `operation` (`'alias_insert'`, `'canonical_promotion'`, `'alias_merge'`), `jobId`, `sourceSystem`, `attempt`, `status`, `error`. Include correlation IDs from upstream app for cross-system traceability.

- **Metrics & dashboards**
  - Counter metrics: `alias.inserts`, `alias.inserts_conflict`, `alias.canonical_promotions`, `alias.canonical_conflicts`, `alias.merge_requests`; tag by `source_system`, `authoritative`, `actor_type` (user/worker/system).
  - Gauge/backlog metrics: `alias.pending_conflicts`, `alias.pending_promotions`, `alias.merge_queue_size` queried nightly via Supabase view + scheduled edge function exporting to metrics store (e.g., Vercel Analytics, Grafana, Lightstep).
  - Latency histogram: time from `collected_at` to canonical resolution for authoritative aliases, derived via Supabase materialized view and pushed as distribution metric.
  - Dashboard layout: (1) Overview panel with insert/conflict trendlines; (2) conflict backlog table filtered by `source_system`; (3) resolution SLA chart; (4) worker job success/failure heatmap. Integrate with existing organiser ops Grafana board by adding new folder `Employer Aliases`.

- **Implementation outline**
  - Phase 1 (current): add shared logging helpers in Next.js/worker layers, create Supabase NOTIFY wrapper returning consistent payloads, and document schema fields for ingestion.
  - Phase 2: during intake flow updates (Prompts 2A–2D), invoke logging helpers upon alias creation, conflict detection, and canonical flag toggles; ensure conflict warnings surface telemetry IDs so organisers can reference dashboards.
  - Phase 3: hook admin consoles into metrics by surfacing counts from Supabase views and linking to Grafana panels; canonical promotion console writes audit trails that feed latency metric.
  - Phase 4: include observability checks in rollout runbook—verify log ingestion, metric exports, and alert thresholds; add alerting rules (e.g., conflict backlog > 25 for 48h, worker alias failure rate > 5%).

---

## Phase 2 — Alias Capture in Intake Flows (parallel once Phase 1 merges)

### Prompt 2A — BCI Import Enhancements
- **Goal**: Ensure every BCI intake name becomes an alias with metadata.
- **Scope**:
  - Update `src/components/upload/BCIProjectImport.tsx` alias insertion to include new fields.
  - Use shared normalization helper to avoid discrepancies.
  - Log conflicts (existing alias pointing to different employer).
  - Add tests or mock flows validating alias persistence when matching vs creating employers.

### Prompt 2B — Pending Employers Flow
- **Goal**: Capture aliases when resolving pending employers and warn about conflicts.
- **Scope**:
  - Modify `PendingEmployersImport.tsx` to create alias records when linking to existing or new employers, with provenance (e.g., `source_system = 'pending_import'`).
  - Surface existing alias matches during duplicate detection.
  - Update pending record notes to reflect alias creation decisions.

### Prompt 2C — Worker & Manual Creation
- **Goal**: Ensure field-created employers add aliases and provide feedback on duplicates.
- **Scope**:
  - Touch `WorkerImport.tsx`, manual employer creation modals/forms.
  - On creation, store the given name as alias; if alias already tied to another employer, warn and prompt for resolution.
  - Leverage shared helper + logging plan.

### Prompt 2D — Background Workers
- **Goal**: Align Incolink + FWC processors with new alias handling.
- **Files**: `railway_workers/cfmeu-scraper-worker/src/processors/incolink.ts`, `.../fwc.ts`.
- **Scope**:
  - Use shared normalization helper (or worker-friendly copy) for search + alias writes.
  - When a worker confirms an employer match, insert alias with metadata (`source_system = 'incolink'` etc.).
  - Add unit/integration tests if available (or document manual validation).

---

## Phase 3 — UX & API Enhancements

### Prompt 3A — Pending Review UX
- **Goal**: Update pending employer UI to display aliases and allow canonical decisions.
- **Scope**:
  - Show current canonical name + alias list when reviewing a pending record.
  - Provide actions: “keep intake name as alias,” “set as canonical,” “merge into existing alias.”
  - Respect logging plan for decisions.
  - Update tests/snapshots as needed.

### Prompt 3B — Canonical Promotion Console
- **Goal**: Build admin tooling for managing canonical name changes.
- **Scope**:
  - Detect when authoritative IDs (BCI, Incolink, EBA) attach; queue for review.
  - Create UI (admin section) summarizing suggestions with accept/reject actions.
  - Record decisions (e.g., Supabase table `employer_canonical_audit`).

#### Prompt 3B Implementation Summary

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Database Layer**
- Created migration `20251015120000_canonical_promotion_system.sql` with:
  - `employer_canonical_audit` table: Records all promotion decisions with action, rationale, conflict warnings, and actor

- Created comprehensive validation checklist: `docs/canonical-promotion-validation.md` with manual test cases, seed data scripts, and sign-off criteria

**Key Features**
- Priority scoring: Authoritative sources = 10, key systems (BCI/Incolink/FWC/EBA) = 5, others = 1
- Conflict detection: Uses PostgreSQL `similarity()` to find employers with matching/similar names (>0.8 threshold)
- Audit trail: Every decision recorded with timestamp, actor, rationale, and conflict metadata
- Telemetry: Logs emitted for all actions for downstream observability dashboards

### Prompt 3C — API & Search Updates
- **Goal**: Allow API + UI search to leverage aliases.
- **Scope**:
  - Update `/api/employers` to join aliases and include them in filters/results.
  - Modify `EmployersDesktopView.tsx` and related hooks/company search components to show alias badges and highlight matches.
  - Ensure pagination/performance remains acceptable (consider new view or RPC).

#### Prompt 3C Implementation Summary — ✅ BACKEND COMPLETE

**Status:** Backend Infrastructure Complete / Frontend Examples Provided  
**Detailed Documentation:** See `PROMPT_3C_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`

**Database Layer** - Created `20251015125000_employer_alias_search.sql` with `search_employers_with_aliases` RPC (searches by name/aliases/external IDs/ABN with 0-100 relevance scoring), `get_employer_aliases` helper, `employer_alias_stats` view, and optimized indexes. Supports configurable match modes: `any`, `authoritative`, `canonical`.

**API Enhancements** - Extended `/api/employers` with `includeAliases` and `aliasMatchMode` parameters. Response includes `aliases[]`, `match_type`, `match_details`, and `search_score`. Fully backward compatible.

**Scoring:** Exact canonical (100), External ID (95), ABN (90), Starts-with (85), Exact alias (80), Contains canonical (70), Contains alias (60).

**Telemetry** - Extended `useAliasTelemetry` with `logSearchQuery` method. Logs query, mode, result count, response time.

  - Hook into observability plan (log ingestion, metrics exports).

#### Prompt 3D Implementation Summary — ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Database Views** - Created `20251015130000_alias_analytics.sql` with 6 comprehensive views:
- `alias_metrics_summary`: Overall counts, source breakdown, recent activity (7/30 days), decision metrics

- `alias_source_system_stats`: Per-source breakdown with averages
- `employer_alias_coverage`: Coverage %, employers with authoritative aliases, gaps (external IDs without aliases)
Plus `get_alias_metrics_range` RPC for date-range queries.

**API Endpoint** - Created `/api/admin/alias-metrics` (GET/POST) for admin/lead_organiser roles. GET returns all metrics in single response. POST enables CSV export (sourceSystems, conflictBacklog). Includes query time debugging.

**Dashboard Component** - Built `AliasAnalyticsDashboard.tsx` with:
- Overview cards: Total aliases, pending reviews, promotions (7d), coverage %
- Resolution time card showing median hours
- Source systems table with totals, authoritative counts, new aliases (7/30 days), export button
- Conflict backlog table (top 10) with priority badges, age buckets, link to full queue

# Database validation (requires SUPABASE env vars)
export $(cat .env | grep SUPABASE | xargs)
pnpm exec playwright test database-validation

# Full suite (requires dev server + auth)
pnpm dev  # In separate terminal
pnpm exec playwright test
```

**Test Validation:** Tests execute successfully, properly skip without env vars, structure validated across all browsers. See `E2E_TESTING_SUMMARY.md` for complete results.

### Prompt 4C — Release Communication & Training
- **Goal**: Prepare organiser-facing documentation.
- **Scope**:
  - Draft release notes summarising new alias behaviour.
  - Provide quick-reference guide for pending review UI and canonical promotion console.
  - Highlight any behavioural changes (e.g., warnings on duplicate trading names).

---

## Coordination Tips

- Maintain a shared tracker (Notion/Jira) to log prompt status and dependencies.
- Schedule check-ins between Phase 1 and Phase 2 teams to confirm normalization contract.
- Encourage agents to flag unexpected schema conflicts immediately to avoid blocking cascades.
