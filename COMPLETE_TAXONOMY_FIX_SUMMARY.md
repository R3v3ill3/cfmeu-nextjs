Categories Tab Dropdown:
  ❌ Shows: Only ~20-30 trades (only those with employers assigned)
  ❌ Missing: cleaning, final_clean, and ~20 others
  
Categories Tab Current:
  ❌ Trades assigned in Edit form don't appear (JOIN fails)
  
EBA Employers Filters:
  ❌ Shows: Only ~20-30 trades  
  ❌ Can't filter by many valid trades
```

### **After All Fixes:**
```
Edit Form Trade Capabilities:
  ✅ Shows: All 53 trades (from TRADE_OPTIONS)
  ✅ Saves to: employer_capabilities
  
Categories Tab Dropdown:
  ✅ Shows: ALL 53 trades (from trade_types table)
  ✅ Shows: ALL contractor roles (from contractor_role_types table)
  ✅ Can assign any valid category
  
Categories Tab Current:

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### **Step 1: Deploy Remaining Migrations**

```bash
cd /Volumes/DataDrive/cursor_repos/cfmeu-nextjs

# This will deploy Migrations 4 and 5
npx supabase db push --include-all
```

### **Step 2: Verify Reference Tables**

```bash
# Check trade_types table is complete
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trade_types WHERE is_active = true) as active_trades,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contractor_role_types WHERE is_active = true) as active_roles,
  EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM trade_types WHERE code = 'cleaning') as has_cleaning;
"
```

**Expected:**
- active_trades: 53
- active_roles: ~15-20
- has_cleaning: t (true)

### **Step 3: Verify Catalog View**

```bash
# Check catalog shows all categories
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
SELECT category_type, COUNT(*) as category_count
FROM v_contractor_categories_catalog
GROUP BY category_type;
"
```

**Expected:**
- contractor_role: ~15-20
- trade: 53

### **Step 4: Test in UI**

1. Open any employer → Categories tab
2. Type selector: "Trade"
3. Category dropdown: Should show ALL 53 trades
4. Try adding "Cleaning" - should work!
5. Go to EBA Employers page
6. Category Type: "Trade"
7. Category dropdown: Should show ALL 53 trades including "Cleaning"

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### **Original Problem:**
Edit form and Categories tab showed different data (dual table systems)

### **Additional Problems Discovered:**
1. Reference tables (`trade_types`, `contractor_role_types`) not fully seeded
2. Catalog view only showed categories in use (not all possible)

### **Complete Solution:**
1. Consolidate to single table (`employer_capabilities`)
2. Seed reference tables completely
3. Update catalog view to show all categories
4. Dual-write for safety
5. Update all UI components

### **Result:**
✅ Single source of truth for capabilities  
✅ Consistent everywhere (Edit, Categories, Filters)  
✅ All 53 trades visible and usable  
✅ Canonical taxonomy applied universally
