- [ ] Environment variable example updated: `.env.example`

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: Database Migration (Development)

### Step 1: Apply Migration Locally

```bash
# Connect to your development database
psql $DEVELOPMENT_DATABASE_URL

# Or use Supabase CLI
supabase db reset # This will apply all migrations including the new one

# Or manually apply the specific migration
psql $DEVELOPMENT_DATABASE_URL -f supabase/migrations/20251017000000_employers_search_materialized_view.sql
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NOTICE:  Performing initial refresh of employers_search_optimized...
NOTICE:  Initial refresh complete!
NOTICE:  ========================================
NOTICE:  Materialized View Migration Complete!
NOTICE:  ========================================
NOTICE:  View: employers_search_optimized
NOTICE:  Rows: 5234
NOTICE:  Size: 12 MB
...
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration Success

```sql
-- Check that view was created
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employers_search_optimized;
-- Should return your employer count

-- Check indexes were created
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'employers_search_optimized'
ORDER BY indexname;
-- Should show ~10 indexes

-- Check monitoring view
SELECT * FROM employers_search_view_status;
-- Should show: health_status = 'OK', staleness < 5 min

-- Test refresh function
SELECT * FROM refresh_employers_search_view_logged('manual');
-- Should return: success=true, duration_ms < 30000
```

### Step 3: Performance Comparison Test

```sql
-- Test OLD query (analytics view)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM employer_analytics
WHERE employer_name ILIKE '%construction%'
LIMIT 100;
-- Note the execution time

-- Test NEW query (materialized view)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM employers_search_optimized
WHERE name ILIKE '%construction%'
AND is_engaged = true
AND eba_category = 'active'
LIMIT 100;
-- Should be MUCH faster (5-10x improvement)
```

**Expected Results:**
```
Analytics view: ~200-500ms
Materialized view: ~20-50ms (10x faster!)
```

---

## 🔧 Phase 2: Set Up Refresh Automation

### Option A: Supabase pg_cron (Recommended)

```sql
-- Enable pg_cron extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;

-- Schedule refresh every 5 minutes
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'refresh-employers-search-view',
  '*/5 * * * *', -- Every 5 minutes
  $$SELECT refresh_employers_search_view_logged('cron');$$
);

-- Verify cron job was created
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'refresh-employers-search-view';

-- Check cron job execution history
SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details 
WHERE jobid = (SELECT jobid FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'refresh-employers-search-view')
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Option B: External Scheduler (Alternative)

If pg_cron is not available, use an external scheduler:

**Using Vercel Cron:**
```typescript
// app/api/cron/refresh-employer-view/route.ts
import { createServerSupabase } from '@/lib/supabase/server';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  // Verify cron secret
  const authHeader = request.headers.get('authorization');
  if (authHeader !== `Bearer ${process.env.CRON_SECRET}`) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
  }

  try {
    const supabase = await createServerSupabase();
    const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc(
      'refresh_employers_search_view_logged',
      { p_triggered_by: 'vercel_cron' }
    );

    if (error) throw error;

    return NextResponse.json({ 
      success: true, 
      data,
      message: 'Employer search view refreshed successfully' 
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Cron refresh failed:', error);
    return NextResponse.json({ 
      success: false, 
      error: String(error) 
    }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

**Configure in `vercel.json`:**
```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/cron/refresh-employer-view",
    "schedule": "*/5 * * * *"
  }]
}
```

**Set environment variable:**
```bash
# Generate a random secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# Set in Vercel dashboard
CRON_SECRET=your-generated-secret
```

### Option C: Railway Cron (Alternative)

```bash
# Add to railway.toml
[[schedules]]
cmd = "curl -X GET https://your-app.com/api/cron/refresh-employer-view -H 'Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET'"
schedule = "*/5 * * * *"
```

---

## 🧪 Phase 3: Local Testing

### Step 1: Configure Environment

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_EMPLOYER_MAT_VIEW=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_DEBUG_BADGES=true
```

### Step 2: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### Step 3: Test Employer Search

1. Navigate to `/employers`
2. Open browser console
3. Perform searches with various filters:
   - Search: "construction"
   - Filter: Engaged + Active EBA
   - Sort by: Name, Estimated workers, EBA recency

**Look for in console:**
```javascript
🚀 Using materialized view for employer search
📊 Server-side query completed in 150ms
{
  debug: {
    queryTime: 150,
    usedMaterializedView: true,
    ...
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Test Rollback

```bash
# Set feature flag to false
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_EMPLOYER_MAT_VIEW=false
```

Restart server and verify:
```javascript
📊 Using analytics view for employer search
{
  debug: {
    queryTime: 850,
    usedMaterializedView: false,
    ...
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Test Data Freshness

```sql
-- Create a test employer
INSERT INTO employers (name, employer_type) 
VALUES ('Test Employer for Mat View', 'small_contractor')
RETURNING id;

-- Check if in view (should NOT be yet)
SELECT * FROM employers_search_optimized 
WHERE name = 'Test Employer for Mat View';
-- Returns 0 rows (view not refreshed)

-- Trigger refresh
SELECT * FROM refresh_employers_search_view_logged('manual');

-- Check again (should be there now)
SELECT * FROM employers_search_optimized 
WHERE name = 'Test Employer for Mat View';
-- Returns 1 row (now in view!)

-- Clean up
DELETE FROM employers WHERE name = 'Test Employer for Mat View';
```

---

## 🌐 Phase 4: Staging Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy Database Migration to Staging

```bash
# Option A: Supabase CLI
supabase db push --project-ref your-staging-project

# Option B: Manual via Supabase Dashboard
# 1. Go to SQL Editor
# 2. Paste migration file contents
# 3. Run query
# 4. Verify success messages
```

### Step 2: Verify Staging Database

```sql
-- Connect to staging database
psql $STAGING_DATABASE_URL

-- Verify view exists and is populated
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employers_search_optimized;

-- Check refresh is working
SELECT * FROM refresh_employers_search_view_logged('manual');

-- Verify monitoring
SELECT * FROM employers_search_view_status;
```

### Step 3: Deploy Code to Staging

```bash
# Enable feature flag in staging environment
# Via hosting provider dashboard (Vercel/Railway)
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_EMPLOYER_MAT_VIEW=true

# Deploy to staging
git push staging main
```

### Step 4: Staging Testing Checklist

- [ ] Employer search loads successfully
- [ ] Console shows "🚀 Using materialized view"
- [ ] Query times improved (check console logs)
- [ ] All filters work correctly:
  - [ ] Text search
  - [ ] Engagement filter (engaged/all)
  - [ ] EBA filter (active/lodged/pending/no/all)
  - [ ] Employer type filter
  - [ ] Sorting (name/estimated/eba_recency)
  - [ ] Pagination
- [ ] Creating new employer works
- [ ] Editing employer works
- [ ] No errors in console
- [ ] No errors in server logs

### Step 5: Load Testing (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Install k6 (if not already installed)
brew install k6  # macOS
# or
choco install k6  # Windows
# or
sudo snap install k6  # Linux

# Create load test script
cat > load-test-employers.js << 'EOF'
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export const options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '30s', target: 10 },  // Ramp up to 10 users
    { duration: '1m', target: 10 },   // Stay at 10 users
    { duration: '30s', target: 20 },  // Ramp up to 20 users
    { duration: '1m', target: 20 },   // Stay at 20 users
    { duration: '30s', target: 0 },   // Ramp down
  ],
};

export default function () {
  const searches = [
    '?q=construction&engaged=true',
    '?q=building&eba=active',
    '?engaged=true&type=large_contractor',
    '?eba=no&sort=name&dir=asc',
    '?sort=estimated&dir=desc',
  ];

  const query = searches[Math.floor(Math.random() * searches.length)];
  const res = http.get(`https://your-staging.com/api/employers${query}`);

  check(res, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'response time < 500ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 500,
    'used mat view': (r) => {
      const body = JSON.parse(r.body);
      return body.debug?.usedMaterializedView === true;
    },
  });

  sleep(1);
}
EOF

# Run load test
k6 run load-test-employers.js
```

**Expected Results:**
```
✓ status is 200             : 95%+
✓ response time < 500ms     : 90%+
✓ used mat view            : 100%
http_req_duration          : avg=200ms p(95)=350ms
```

## 🚀 Phase 5: Production Deployment

### Strategy: Gradual Rollout with Feature Flag

This approach allows testing with real traffic before full rollout.

### Step 1: Deploy Database Migration to Production

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Take a backup first!
# Via Supabase dashboard or CLI

# Option A: Supabase CLI
supabase db dump --project-ref your-prod-project > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
supabase db push --project-ref your-prod-project

# Option B: Manual via Dashboard
# 1. Create backup first
# 2. Go to SQL Editor
# 3. Paste migration file
# 4. Run query
# 5. Verify success
```

### Step 2: Verify Production Database

```sql
-- Quick health check
SELECT * FROM employers_search_view_status;
-- health_status should be 'OK'

-- Verify data accuracy
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as view_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employers) as table_count,
  COUNT(*) - (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employers) as difference
FROM employers_search_optimized;
-- difference should be 0 or very small

-- Test refresh
SELECT * FROM refresh_employers_search_view_logged('manual');
-- success should be true, duration_ms < 30000
```

### Step 3: Deploy Code (Feature Flag OFF Initially)

```bash
# Set feature flag to FALSE for initial deployment
# Via Vercel/Railway dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_EMPLOYER_MAT_VIEW=false

# Deploy to production
git push production main
```

**Why start with flag OFF?**
- Ensures code changes don't break existing functionality
- Allows testing materialized view in production without user impact
- Can enable gradually

### Step 4: Test Materialized View in Production (Admin Only)

```typescript
// Temporary code for admin testing (remove after rollout)
// Add to src/app/api/employers/route.ts temporarily

const USE_MATERIALIZED_VIEW = 
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_EMPLOYER_MAT_VIEW !== 'false' ||
  user?.email === 'admin@cfmeu.org.au'; // Your admin email
```

Test as admin:
- Verify materialized view works correctly
- Check query times in console
- Test all functionality

### Step 5: Gradual Rollout

**Day 1-2: 10% Traffic**
```bash
# Update environment variable
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_EMPLOYER_MAT_VIEW=true

# Add random sampling (temporarily in route.ts)
const USE_MATERIALIZED_VIEW = 
  (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_EMPLOYER_MAT_VIEW !== 'false') &&
  (Math.random() < 0.1); // 10% of users

# Deploy
```

**Monitor:**
- Error rate (should not increase)
- Query times (should decrease significantly)
- User reports (should have none or positive feedback)

**Day 3-5: 50% Traffic**
```typescript
const USE_MATERIALIZED_VIEW = 
  (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_EMPLOYER_MAT_VIEW !== 'false') &&
  (Math.random() < 0.5); // 50% of users
```

**Day 6-7: 100% Traffic**
```typescript
// Remove sampling code, use feature flag only
const USE_MATERIALIZED_VIEW = 
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_EMPLOYER_MAT_VIEW !== 'false';
```

---

## 📊 Phase 6: Monitoring & Validation

### Set Up Monitoring Queries

```sql
-- Create monitoring view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW mat_view_health_dashboard AS
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employers) as total_employers,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employers_search_optimized) as view_employers,
  (SELECT view_refreshed_at FROM employers_search_optimized LIMIT 1) as last_refresh,
  (SELECT NOW() - view_refreshed_at FROM employers_search_optimized LIMIT 1) as staleness,
  (SELECT AVG(duration_ms) FROM mat_view_refresh_log WHERE refreshed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours') as avg_refresh_time_24h,
  (SELECT MAX(duration_ms) FROM mat_view_refresh_log WHERE refreshed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours') as max_refresh_time_24h,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mat_view_refresh_log WHERE success = false AND refreshed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours') as failed_refreshes_24h,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('employers_search_optimized')) as total_size;

GRANT SELECT ON mat_view_health_dashboard TO authenticated;

-- Check health
SELECT * FROM mat_view_health_dashboard;
```

### Daily Monitoring Checklist

**Morning Check (First Week):**
```sql
-- Health dashboard
SELECT * FROM mat_view_health_dashboard;

-- Recent refresh history
SELECT * FROM mat_view_refresh_log
WHERE refreshed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY refreshed_at DESC;

-- Check for slow refreshes
SELECT * FROM mat_view_refresh_log
WHERE duration_ms > 30000
AND refreshed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

**Alerts to Set Up:**

1. **Stale View Alert**
   ```sql
   SELECT CASE 
     WHEN NOW() - view_refreshed_at > INTERVAL '10 minutes'
     THEN 'ALERT: View is stale!'
     ELSE 'OK'
   END as status
   FROM employers_search_optimized
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

2. **Slow Refresh Alert**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM mat_view_refresh_log
   WHERE duration_ms > 30000
   AND refreshed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
   ```

3. **Failed Refresh Alert**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM mat_view_refresh_log
   WHERE success = false
   AND refreshed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
   ```

### Application Monitoring

**Check Debug Output:**
```javascript
// In browser console when using employers page
console.log(response.debug);
// Should show:
// {
//   queryTime: 150,
//   usedMaterializedView: true,
//   ...
// }
```

**Set Up Application Logging:**
```typescript
// Add to API route (already done)
if (queryTime > 1000) {
  console.warn('⚠️ SLOW QUERY', {
    queryTime,
    usedMaterializedView,
    filters: { q, engaged, eba, type }
  });
}
```

---

## 🔙 Rollback Procedures

### Instant Rollback (< 5 minutes)

**If Issues Occur:**

1. **Disable Feature Flag**
   ```bash
   # Via hosting provider dashboard (Vercel/Railway)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_EMPLOYER_MAT_VIEW=false
   
   # Trigger redeployment
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Rollback: Disable materialized view"
   git push production main
   ```

2. **Wait for Deployment**
   - Vercel: ~2-3 minutes
   - Railway: ~3-5 minutes

3. **Verify Rollback**
   - Check console: Should see "📊 Using analytics view"
   - Check debug.usedMaterializedView: should be false

### Partial Rollback (Reduce Traffic)

**If Issues Affect Some Users:**

```typescript
// Reduce to 10% traffic
const USE_MATERIALIZED_VIEW = 
  (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_EMPLOYER_MAT_VIEW !== 'false') &&
  (Math.random() < 0.1);
```

### Complete Removal (Last Resort)

**If Materialized View Must Be Removed:**

```sql
-- Drop materialized view
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS employers_search_optimized CASCADE;

-- Drop functions
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS refresh_employers_search_view();
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS refresh_employers_search_view_logged(text);

-- Drop monitoring
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS employers_search_view_status;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mat_view_refresh_log;

-- Stop cron job (if using pg_cron)
SELECT cron.unschedule('refresh-employers-search-view');
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: View Not Refreshing

**Symptoms:**
- Staleness > 10 minutes
- New employers not appearing in search

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Check last refresh time
SELECT view_refreshed_at, NOW() - view_refreshed_at as staleness
FROM employers_search_optimized LIMIT 1;

-- Check refresh logs
SELECT * FROM mat_view_refresh_log
ORDER BY refreshed_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check if cron is running
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'refresh-employers-search-view';
```

**Solutions:**
1. Manual refresh: `SELECT * FROM refresh_employers_search_view_logged('manual');`
2. Check cron job is scheduled correctly
3. Verify database permissions
4. Check for locks: `SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE relation = 'employers_search_optimized'::regclass;`

### Issue: Slow Refresh Times

**Symptoms:**
- Refresh takes > 30 seconds
- Database CPU spikes during refresh

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Check refresh duration trend
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', refreshed_at) as hour,
  AVG(duration_ms) as avg_ms,
  MAX(duration_ms) as max_ms
FROM mat_view_refresh_log
WHERE refreshed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour DESC;

-- Check view size
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('employers_search_optimized'));
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check for missing indexes on source tables
2. Analyze source tables: `ANALYZE employers, company_eba_records, worker_placements, project_assignments;`
3. Consider reducing refresh frequency to every 10 minutes
4. Review query plan: `EXPLAIN ANALYZE REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY employers_search_optimized;`

### Issue: Query Still Slow

**Symptoms:**
- Query times not improved
- Console shows materialized view is being used

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Check if indexes are being used
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM employers_search_optimized
WHERE name ILIKE '%test%'
AND is_engaged = true
AND eba_category = 'active';

-- Check table statistics
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE relname = 'employers_search_optimized';
```

**Solutions:**
1. Run `ANALYZE employers_search_optimized;`
2. Verify indexes exist: `\d employers_search_optimized`
3. Check for table bloat: `VACUUM ANALYZE employers_search_optimized;`
4. Review query plan for sequential scans

### Issue: Data Mismatch

**Symptoms:**
- Employer count different between view and table
- Missing employers in search

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Compare counts
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employers) as table_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employers_search_optimized) as view_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employers) - (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employers_search_optimized) as difference;

-- Find employers not in view
SELECT e.id, e.name FROM employers e
LEFT JOIN employers_search_optimized v ON v.id = e.id
WHERE v.id IS NULL;
```

**Solutions:**
1. Force full refresh: `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW employers_search_optimized;`
2. Check for errors in refresh log
3. Verify source data integrity
4. If persistent, drop and recreate view
