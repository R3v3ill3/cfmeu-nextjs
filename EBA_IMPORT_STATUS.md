# EBA Trade Import - Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ What's Implemented (Ready to Use)

### 1. Upload & Parse with AI ‚úÖ
- Multi-file PDF upload with drag & drop
- Auto-detect trade types from filenames
- Claude AI parsing of employer lists
- Real-time progress and cost tracking
- Error handling per file

### 2. Parse Review Screen ‚úÖ
**This is the new manual review step you requested!**

After parsing completes, you get a review screen where you can:
- **View all parsed employers** in an editable table
- **Edit any details**: company name, address, phone, etc.
- **Mark invalid**: Uncheck employers that shouldn't be imported
- **Remove entries**: Delete incorrect or duplicate records
- **Add notes**: Context for later review
- **Bulk validation**: Only checked employers are stored

**How it works**:
1. Upload PDFs ‚Üí Parse with AI
2. **Review screen appears automatically**
3. Edit/validate employers
4. Click "Store X Employers in Pending Queue"
5. Validated employers saved to `pending_employers` table

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs to be Added (Next Steps)

### 2. Manual Matching Per Employer 

**You said**: *"I'd like an option to review each specific employer and run a manual search for a match"*

**Status**: Needs to be added to `PendingEmployersImport` component

**What's needed**:
- Add "Manual Match" button per pending employer
- Search dialog to find existing employers
- User selects match or creates new
- Store match decision

**Where**: Admin ‚Üí Employer Management ‚Üí **Import Pending Employers** tab

---

### 3. FWC EBA Search Automation

**You said**: *"I'd like to run a FWC search for any new employer being added, or for any matched employer that does not have an EBA status = yes"*

**Status**: Needs to be added to `PendingEmployersImport` component

**What's needed**:
- Auto-identify employers needing FWC search:
  - New employers (no match found)
  - Matched employers without EBA status
- "Batch FWC Search" button
- Process each employer through FWC search
- Attach EBA records to employers

**Where**: Admin ‚Üí Employer Management ‚Üí **Import Pending Employers** tab

---

## Current Workflow (What You Can Do Now)

### ‚úÖ Steps 1-2: Upload, Parse & Review (WORKING)

1. Go to: **Admin ‚Üí Employer Management ‚Üí EBA Trade Import**
2. Upload PDF files (e.g., "Bricklaying as of 1.10.25.pdf")
3. Click **"Parse All Files with AI"**
4. Wait for parsing to complete (~7 seconds per PDF)
5. **Review screen appears**:
   - Table shows all parsed employers
   - Click edit icon to modify any employer
   - Uncheck box to mark as invalid
   - Click trash to remove
   - Add notes if needed
6. Click **"Store X Employers in Pending Queue"**
7. Success! Employers stored with:
   - `source`: `eba_trade_pdf:batch_id:filename`
   - `our_role`: `subcontractor`
   - `inferred_trade_type`: The trade from PDF
   - `import_status`: `pending`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Steps 3-4: Match & FWC Search (TODO)

1. Switch to **"Import Pending Employers"** tab
2. **Currently available**:
   - Automatic duplicate detection runs
   - Can import employers as-is
   - Manual FWC search per employer (click employer ‚Üí search FWC)
   
3. **Needs enhancement**:
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual match button per employer
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Batch FWC search for candidates
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Auto-trigger FWC for new/no-EBA employers

## Implementation Plan for Remaining Features

### Feature 1: Manual Matching

**File**: `src/components/upload/PendingEmployersImport.tsx`

**Add to each pending employer row**:
```typescript
<Button
  variant="outline"
  size="sm"
  onClick={() => openManualMatchDialog(employer)}
>
  <Search className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
  Manual Match
</Button>
```

**Search Dialog**:
- Search all employers (bypass RLS)
- Show similarity scores
- Display employer details (ABN, address, EBA status)
- Options: Select Match | Create New | Skip

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

---

### Feature 2: Batch FWC Search

**File**: `src/components/upload/PendingEmployersImport.tsx`

**Add batch identification**:
```typescript
const needsFwcSearch = pendingEmployers.filter(emp => {
  // New employers
  if (emp.match_decision === 'create_new') return true
  
  // Matched but no EBA
  if (emp.matched_employer_id) {
    const existing = getEmployer(emp.matched_employer_id)
    return !existing?.enterprise_agreement_status
  }
  
  return false
})
```

**Add batch button**:
```typescript
{needsFwcSearch.length > 0 && (
  <Button onClick={runBatchFwcSearch}>
    <Search className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
    Run FWC Search ({needsFwcSearch.length} employers)
  </Button>
)}
```

**Process**:
- Loop through candidates
- Call existing FWC search API
- Present results in modal
- User selects EBA to attach
- Update employer records

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

## Questions?

**Q: Can I use this now?**  
A: Yes! The parse & review workflow is fully functional. You can upload PDFs, review parsed employers, edit details, and store them in the pending queue.

**Q: What about matching and FWC search?**  
A: Those features need to be added to the PendingEmployersImport component. The current automatic duplicate detection works, and you can manually search FWC per employer, but the bulk/automated workflows you requested need implementation.

**Q: Will my edits be preserved?**  
A: Yes! All edits and notes are stored in the `raw` JSONB field and can be accessed during import.
