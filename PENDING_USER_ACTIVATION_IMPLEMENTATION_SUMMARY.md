# Pending User Activation - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All components of the generic pending user activation system have been successfully implemented based on the lessons learned from the Chris Pappas migration.

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Function ✅
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251010050000_pending_user_activation_function.sql`

A comprehensive PostgreSQL function that handles the complete activation process:

```sql
activate_pending_user(p_pending_email text, p_activated_email text)
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Validates inputs and handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Cleans invalid patch IDs before migration (prevents trigger violations)
- ✅ Migrates all hierarchy relationships:
  - Draft lead → live organisers: Creates `role_hierarchy` entries
  - Draft lead → pending organisers: Creates `lead_draft_organiser_links` entries
  - Updates `draft_lead_organiser_links` where user is pending organiser
  - Live leads → pending organiser: Creates `role_hierarchy` entries
- ✅ Transfers role from pending_user to activated profile
- ✅ Migrates patch assignments to appropriate tables based on role
- ✅ Archives the pending_user with detailed notes
- ✅ Returns detailed JSON summary with counts

**Return Format**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "pending_user_id": "uuid",
  "activated_user_id": "uuid",
  "pending_email": "cpappas@testing.org",
  "activated_email": "cpappas@cfmeu.org",
  "role": "lead_organiser",
  "full_name": "Chris Pappas",
  "hierarchy_migrated": {
    "role_hierarchy_created": 5,
    "lead_draft_links_created": 3,
    "draft_links_updated": 2,
    "links_deactivated": 10
  },
  "patches_migrated": 4,
  "invalid_patches_cleaned": 2
}
```

### 2. API Endpoint ✅
**File**: `src/app/api/admin/activate-pending-user/route.ts`

REST API endpoint that wraps the database function:

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/admin/activate-pending-user`

**Features**:
- ✅ Admin-only access control
- ✅ Auto-converts `@testing.org` → `@cfmeu.org` if activated email not provided
- ✅ Input validation for email formats
- ✅ Calls database function via Supabase RPC
- ✅ Returns formatted success/error responses

**Request Body**:
```typescript
{
  pendingEmail: "cpappas@testing.org",
  activatedEmail?: "cpappas@cfmeu.org" // Optional, auto-generated if not provided
}
```

### 3. Helper Utilities ✅
**File**: `src/utils/emailConversion.ts`

Reusable utility functions for email handling:

- `convertTestingToProductionEmail(email)` - Converts @testing.org to @cfmeu.org
- `isTestingEmail(email)` - Checks if email is a testing email
- `isProductionEmail(email)` - Checks if email is a production CFMEU email
- `extractUserFromEmail(email)` - Gets username from email
- `isValidEmail(email)` - Validates email format
- `canActivatePendingUser(email, status)` - Determines if activate button should show

### 4. Activation Dialog Component ✅
**File**: `src/components/admin/ActivatePendingUserDialog.tsx`

Beautiful, user-friendly dialog for activating pending users:

**Features**:
- ✅ Shows all pending user details (name, role, email, patches)
- ✅ Auto-generates activated email with option to override
- ✅ Clear warning about what will happen
- ✅ Loading states with spinner
- ✅ Error handling with clear messages
- ✅ Success screen with detailed migration summary:
  - Shows hierarchy relationships migrated
  - Shows patch assignments migrated
  - Shows invalid patches cleaned
  - Auto-closes after 3 seconds
- ✅ Beautiful icons and visual feedback

### 5. Updated PendingUsersTable ✅
**File**: `src/components/admin/PendingUsersTable.tsx`

Enhanced the existing table to support activation:

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added "Activate" button (green) for users with @testing.org emails
- ✅ Button only shows when `canActivatePendingUser()` returns true
- ✅ Integrated `ActivatePendingUserDialog` component
- ✅ Fetches `assigned_patch_ids` in query
- ✅ Refreshes table after successful activation
- ✅ Shows success toast with migration details

**UX Flow**:
1. Admin sees pending users in the table
2. Users with @testing.org emails show green "Activate" button
3. Clicking "Activate" opens dialog with details
4. Admin can review and optionally edit the activated email
5. Clicking "Activate User" triggers the migration
6. Success screen shows detailed counts
7. Table refreshes automatically
8. Pending user status changes to "archived"

## Key Improvements from Chris Pappas Migration

### Issues Resolved:
1. ✅ **Table Name**: Uses `role_hierarchy` not `lead_organiser_links`
2. ✅ **Invalid Patches**: Cleans invalid patch IDs before migration (prevents FK violations)
3. ✅ **Role Transfer**: Properly updates activated user's role
4. ✅ **Patch Tables**: Correctly inserts into role-specific patch assignment tables
5. ✅ **Error Handling**: Returns JSON errors instead of raising exceptions
6. ✅ **Detailed Feedback**: Provides counts for all operations

### Safeguards Added:
- Transaction-based approach (rolls back on error)
- Validation of both emails before processing
- Checks for existing activated user (won't create duplicate)
- Preserves existing data in activated profile
- Archives (doesn't delete) pending user for audit trail
- Detailed logging via RAISE NOTICE for debugging

## Testing Checklist

Run the migration yourself to verify. To execute the SQL migration:

```bash
# Apply the migration
supabase db push

# Or if using direct SQL:
psql $DATABASE_URL -f supabase/migrations/20251010050000_pending_user_activation_function.sql
```

### Manual Testing Steps:

#### Test 1: Basic Organiser Activation
- [ ] Create pending organiser with @testing.org email
- [ ] Assign some patches
- [ ] Have them sign in to create profile with @cfmeu.org email
- [ ] Click "Activate" button
- [ ] Verify role transferred
- [ ] Verify patches migrated to `organiser_patch_assignments`
- [ ] Verify pending user status = 'archived'

#### Test 2: Lead Organiser with Team
- [ ] Create pending lead_organiser with @testing.org email
- [ ] Assign patches and some organisers under them
- [ ] Have them sign in with @cfmeu.org email
- [ ] Click "Activate" button
- [ ] Verify all hierarchy relationships migrated to `role_hierarchy`
- [ ] Verify patches migrated to `lead_organiser_patch_assignments`
- [ ] Verify all team relationships intact

#### Test 3: Pending Organiser Under Live Lead
- [ ] Create live lead_organiser
- [ ] Create pending organiser with @testing.org email
- [ ] Link pending organiser to live lead via `lead_draft_organiser_links`
- [ ] Have pending organiser sign in with @cfmeu.org email
- [ ] Click "Activate" button
- [ ] Verify relationship created in `role_hierarchy`
- [ ] Verify old link deactivated

#### Test 4: Invalid Patch IDs
- [ ] Create pending lead with invalid patch ID in `assigned_patch_ids`
- [ ] Create pending organiser under them (also with invalid patch)
- [ ] Activate the lead
- [ ] Verify invalid patches cleaned without error
- [ ] Verify success message shows count of cleaned patches

#### Test 5: Edge Cases
- [ ] Try to activate with no activated user profile (should error gracefully)
- [ ] Try to activate already archived user (button shouldn't show)
- [ ] Try to activate user with no relationships (should succeed with 0 counts)
- [ ] Try with non-@testing.org email (button shouldn't show)

#### Test 6: UI/UX
- [ ] Activate button only shows for @testing.org emails
- [ ] Activate button is green and prominent
- [ ] Dialog shows all user details correctly
- [ ] Activated email auto-populates correctly
- [ ] Can manually edit activated email
- [ ] Loading spinner shows during activation
- [ ] Error messages display clearly
- [ ] Success screen shows accurate counts
- [ ] Dialog auto-closes after success
- [ ] Table refreshes showing updated status

## Usage Instructions

### For Admins:

1. **Setup**: Ensure pending user has @testing.org email format
2. **Invitation**: Send invite to the user for their @cfmeu.org email
3. **User Signs In**: User must sign in at least once to create their profile
4. **Activation**: 
   - Go to Administration page → Invites tab
   - Find the user with @testing.org email
   - Click green "Activate" button
   - Review details in dialog
   - Click "Activate User"
   - Wait for success message
5. **Verification**: Check that user now appears in Users tab with correct role

### For Developers:

To activate a user programmatically:

```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('activate_pending_user', {
  p_pending_email: 'user@testing.org',
  p_activated_email: 'user@cfmeu.org'
})

if (data.success) {
  console.log('Migration summary:', data)
} else {
  console.error('Activation failed:', data.error)
}
```

## Database Schema Reference

### Tables Involved:
- `pending_users` - Source of pending user data
- `profiles` - Destination for activated users
- `role_hierarchy` - Live lead ↔ live organiser relationships
- `draft_lead_organiser_links` - Pending lead ↔ organiser relationships
- `lead_draft_organiser_links` - Live lead ↔ pending organiser relationships
- `organiser_patch_assignments` - Patch assignments for organisers
- `lead_organiser_patch_assignments` - Patch assignments for lead_organisers
- `patches` - Reference table for valid patches

### Triggers That Fire:
- `sync_lead_patches_on_draft_links_change` - Syncs patches when lead-draft links change
  - **Note**: This is why we clean invalid patch IDs first!

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:

1. **Bulk Activation**: Select multiple users and activate them all at once
2. **Rollback Function**: Create `deactivate_user()` to undo an activation
3. **Audit Trail**: Add `user_activations` table to track who activated whom
4. **Email Notifications**: Send welcome email when user is activated
5. **Conflict Resolution**: UI to handle email conflicts visually
6. **Preview Mode**: Show what would be migrated before confirming
7. **Validation Rules**: Prevent activation if setup incomplete
8. **Activity Log**: Show history of activations in admin dashboard

## Success Metrics
