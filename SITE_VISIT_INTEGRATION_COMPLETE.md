## 🚨 Important Notes

### Database Migrations Required
**⚠️ YOU MUST RUN MIGRATIONS BEFORE USING THE FEATURE**

The following migrations must be applied to your Supabase database:
1. `supabase/migrations/20251015150000_enhance_site_visits.sql`
2. `supabase/migrations/20251015150100_site_visit_analytics.sql`

Without these migrations:
- Forms will error when submitting
- Badges won't load data
- Custom reasons won't work

### After Applying Migrations

Verify they worked:
```sql
-- Should return 8 global reasons
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM site_visit_reason_definitions WHERE is_global = true;

-- Should show the new views
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.views 
WHERE table_name LIKE 'v_%visit%';

-- Should show 3 new tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name LIKE '%site_visit%';
```

## 🎁 Bonus Features Included

When you click "Record Site Visit" from a project card/table, the form:
- Auto-selects the project

### 2. Visit History Viewer
The new Site Visits tab on project pages shows:
- All visits in reverse chronological order
- Visual cards with key info
- Draft status badges
- Quick view/edit access
- Empty state with call-to-action

### 3. Smart Form Behavior
The enhanced form:
- Auto-selects single sites (if project has one site)
- Pre-fills organiser for organiser role users
- Shows relevant reasons based on user's lead
- Collapses less-used reasons under "Show more"
- Validates required fields

- **Deployment**: `QUICK_DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md`
- **Integration Steps**: `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`

### Common Questions

**Q: Where's the geofencing toggle?**
A: Create a settings page and add the `<GeofencingSetup />` component, or add it to an existing settings/preferences page.

**Q: Can users see all visits or only their own?**
A: Currently all authenticated users can see all visits (organization-wide visibility). This can be modified via RLS policies if needed.

**Q: Can I add more global visit reasons?**
A: Yes, insert directly into `site_visit_reason_definitions` with `is_global = true`, or create a seed data migration.

**Q: Will this work on mobile?**
A: Yes! All components are fully responsive. Geofencing works on mobile when app is open.
