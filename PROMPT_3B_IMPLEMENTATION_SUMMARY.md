# Prompt 3B Implementation Summary
## Canonical Promotion Console

**Implementation Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully implemented Prompt 3B from the Employer Alias Initiative, creating a comprehensive Canonical Promotion Console that allows administrators to review and approve employer name changes from authoritative sources (BCI, Incolink, EBA, FWC).

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Layer
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251015120000_canonical_promotion_system.sql`

Created three core database structures:

#### A. `employer_canonical_audit` Table
Records every canonical name decision with full audit trail:
- `action` (promote/reject/defer)
- `previous_canonical_name` and `proposed_canonical_name`
- `decision_rationale` for transparency
- `decided_by` and `decided_at` for accountability
- `is_authoritative` and `source_system` for provenance
- `conflict_warnings` (JSONB) for detected naming conflicts
- Indexed on employer_id, decided_at, and action

#### B. `canonical_promotion_queue` View
Intelligent queue that:
- Shows aliases eligible for canonical promotion
- Prioritizes by source authority (10=authoritative, 5=key systems, 1=others)
- Detects conflicts with existing employer names (>0.8 similarity)
- Shows previous deferral decisions
- Links to external IDs (BCI, Incolink)
- Orders by priority and collection date

#### C. Three RPC Functions
- **`promote_alias_to_canonical`**: Updates employer's canonical name, records audit trail, detects conflicts
- **`reject_canonical_promotion`**: Rejects suggestion with required rationale
- **`defer_canonical_promotion`**: Defers decision for later review

All functions emit `RAISE LOG` events for observability integration.

### 2. TypeScript Types
**File:** `src/types/database.ts`

Added complete type definitions:
- `employer_canonical_audit` table types (Row, Insert, Update, Relationships)
- `canonical_promotion_queue` view type with all columns
- RPC function signatures with correct parameter types

### 3. UI Component
**File:** `src/components/admin/CanonicalPromotionConsole.tsx`

Rich admin console featuring:

**Queue Display:**
- Card-based layout showing each promotion candidate
- Priority badges (High/Medium/Low) with color coding
- Source system badges (Authoritative, BCI, Incolink, FWC, EBA)
- Current vs. proposed name comparison
- External links to employer detail pages
- Metadata: source identifier, collection date, total aliases

**Conflict Detection:**
- Alert box highlighting similar employer names
- Similarity percentage displayed
- Quick links to conflicting employer records
- Warns before promoting potentially duplicate names

**Decision Workflow:**
- Three action buttons: Defer, Reject, Promote
- Modal dialog for each action
- Required rationale for Reject/Defer
- Optional rationale for Promote
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for feedback

**Special Features:**
- "Previously Deferred" alert for re-queued items
- "All caught up!" empty state when queue is clear
- Loading skeletons during data fetch
- Telemetry integration via `useAliasTelemetry` hook

### 4. Admin Integration
**File:** `src/app/(app)/admin/page.tsx`

Added new "Canonical Names" section:
- Desktop: New tab in admin tabs list
- Mobile: New collapsible accordion section
- Positioned logically before "Data Management"
- Restricted to admin users only

### 5. Testing & Documentation

#### Unit Tests
**File:** `src/__tests__/canonical-promotion.test.ts`

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- RPC function calls and responses
- Queue filtering and prioritization logic
- Conflict detection
- Audit record structure
- Priority calculation algorithm
- Error handling scenarios

#### Validation Checklist
**File:** `docs/canonical-promotion-validation.md`

Complete manual testing guide including:
- Database validation steps
- UI component testing checklist
- Manual test cases with seed data scripts
- Observability validation
- Performance benchmarks
- Final sign-off criteria

## Key Features

### Priority System
- **Priority 10**: Authoritative aliases (manually marked as authoritative)
- **Priority 5**: Key system sources (BCI, Incolink, FWC, EBA) with external IDs
- **Priority 1**: Other sources

### Conflict Detection
Uses PostgreSQL's `similarity()` function to:
- Find employers with matching names (case-insensitive)
- Detect similar names (>0.8 similarity threshold)
- Display warnings before promotion
- Provide links for review

### Audit Trail
Every decision captures:
- Who made the decision
- When it was made
- What changed (before/after names)
- Why it was made (rationale)
- Any conflicts detected
- Source provenance

### Telemetry Integration
Logs all promotion events:
- Event type: `alias.insert` for promotions
- Includes: employerId, alias, normalized, sourceSystem, notes
- Scope: `canonical_promotion_console`
- Actor: Current user ID

## File Changes

### New Files Created

2. `src/components/admin/CanonicalPromotionConsole.tsx` - Main UI component
3. `src/__tests__/canonical-promotion.test.ts` - Unit tests
4. `docs/canonical-promotion-validation.md` - Validation checklist
5. `PROMPT_3B_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This document

2. `src/app/(app)/admin/page.tsx` - Added Canonical Names tab/collapsible
3. `ALIAS_MULTI_AGENT_PROMPTS.md` - Updated with implementation summary

## How to Use

### For Administrators

1. **Access the Console:**
   - Navigate to Admin page
   - Click "Canonical Names" tab (desktop) or expand collapsible (mobile)

2. **Review Queue Items:**
   - Items are sorted by priority (highest first)
   - Review proposed name, source, and any conflicts
   - Check external links to employer and conflict pages

3. **Make Decisions:**
   - **Promote**: Accept the proposed name as the new canonical name
     - Optional: Add rationale explaining why
     - Updates employer name system-wide
   - **Reject**: Decline the promotion
     - Required: Explain why (e.g., "Outdated name", "Prefer current")
     - Keeps current canonical name
   - **Defer**: Skip for now, revisit later
     - Required: Note reason for deferral (e.g., "Need to verify with team")
     - Item remains in queue with "Previously Deferred" alert

4. **Handle Conflicts:**
   - If conflicts appear, review similar employer names
   - May need to merge duplicate employers first
   - Can still promote if intentional (e.g., different branches)

### For Developers

1. **Run Migration:**
   ```bash
   cd supabase
   supabase migration up
   ```

2. **Seed Test Data:**
   Use SQL from `docs/canonical-promotion-validation.md`

3. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   pnpm test src/__tests__/canonical-promotion.test.ts
   ```

4. **Manual Testing:**
   Follow validation checklist in `docs/canonical-promotion-validation.md`

## Next Steps

### Recommended Follow-ups (Optional)

1. **RLS Policies**: Add Row Level Security to restrict `employer_canonical_audit` access
2. **Notifications**: Send email/Slack alerts when high-priority items appear in queue
3. **Batch Actions**: Allow selecting and processing multiple queue items at once
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Integrate with Prompt 3D analytics for promotion metrics
5. **Automatic Promotion**: Configure rules for auto-promoting from specific authoritative sources

### Integration with Other Prompts

- **Prompt 2A-2D**: As intake flows create aliases with `is_authoritative=true`, they'll appear in this queue
- **Prompt 3A**: Pending review UX can link to this console for canonical decisions
- **Prompt 3C**: Search UI will benefit from cleaned-up canonical names
- **Prompt 3D**: Analytics dashboard can show promotion metrics from audit table

## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Queue view uses indexes for fast filtering
- Conflict detection limited to 5 results per alias
- Similarity calculation cached in view for performance

### Security
- Functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` with explicit auth checks
- All functions check `auth.uid()` before proceeding
- Admin page restricts console to admin users
- Consider adding RLS policies for production

### Observability
- SQL functions emit LOG-level events
- Application logs via telemetry hook
- Audit table provides complete decision history
- Ready for integration with Grafana/metrics systems

## Known Limitations

1. **Similarity Threshold**: Fixed at 0.8 - may need tuning based on real data
2. **Manual Process**: Requires admin review - no automatic promotion rules yet
3. **No Bulk Actions**: Must process items one at a time
4. **No Undo**: Promotions change canonical name immediately (use Reject on re-queue to revert)

## Success Criteria

✅ All database structures created and tested  
✅ TypeScript types generated  
✅ UI component renders without errors  
✅ Admin page integration complete  
✅ Telemetry logging functional  
✅ Unit tests written and passing  
✅ Validation checklist created  
✅ No linting errors  
✅ Documentation updated  

## Conclusion

Prompt 3B is **fully implemented and ready for deployment**. The Canonical Promotion Console provides a robust, user-friendly interface for managing employer name promotions from authoritative sources, with full audit trails, conflict detection, and observability integration.

The implementation follows best practices:
- Database-first design with proper constraints and indexes
- Type-safe TypeScript throughout
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Full audit trail for compliance
- Telemetry for operational visibility
- Thorough testing and validation documentation

Administrators can now confidently promote authoritative employer names while avoiding duplicates and maintaining a complete history of all decisions.
