# Pending Employers Manual Match Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Status: Successfully Implemented

All 7 steps from the implementation guide have been completed successfully.

## Changes Summary

### ✅ Database Migration
- **File**: `supabase/migrations/0100_add_pending_employer_status_values.sql`
- Added status values: `'matched'`, `'create_new'`
- Added `matched_employer_id` column
- Migration already pushed by user

### ✅ Step 1: Import Added
- Line 20: Added `import { EbaEmployerMatchDialog } from './EbaEmployerMatchDialog';`

### ✅ Step 2: State Variables Added
- Lines 154-177: Added three new state variables:
  - `manualMatchDialog` - Controls manual match dialog
  - `deleteConfirmDialog` - Controls delete confirmation dialog
  - `showSkipped` - Filter toggle for skipped employers

### ✅ Step 3: Handler Functions Added
- Lines 413-621: Added 8 new handler functions:
  - `openManualMatch()` - Opens manual match dialog
  - `handleManualMatchSelect()` - Saves manual match to database
  - `handleManualMatchCreateNew()` - Marks employer as create new
  - `handleManualMatchSkip()` - Skips employer from dialog
  - `skipPendingEmployer()` - Quick skip without dialog
  - `openDeleteConfirm()` - Opens delete confirmation dialog
  - `confirmDeletePendingEmployer()` - Deletes employer from database
  - `switchToManualMatch()` - Switches from automatic to manual matching

### ✅ Step 4: Action Buttons Added
- Lines 2247-2320: Added conditional action buttons to employer rendering:
  - **Scenario 1** (Has automatic match):
    - Confirm Match button
    - Different Match button
    - Create New button
    - Delete button
  - **Scenario 2** (No automatic match):
    - Manual Match button
    - Skip button
    - Delete button

### ✅ Step 5: Dialog Components Added
- Lines 3054-3090: Added two dialog components:
  - `EbaEmployerMatchDialog` - Search and match employers
  - Delete confirmation dialog - Confirms deletion with Cancel/Delete buttons

### ✅ Step 6: Filter Logic Updated
- Lines 374-386: Updated `loadPendingEmployers()` to:
  - Build dynamic status filter
  - Include skipped employers when `showSkipped` is true
  - Always include `'matched'` and `'create_new'` statuses
- Line 416: Added `showSkipped` to useCallback dependencies
- Lines 2081-2100: Added filter toggle UI with two checkboxes

### ✅ Step 7: Import Logic Updated
- Lines 629-692: Added manual match handling in `createEmployer()`:
  - Check for `import_status === 'matched'` (highest priority)
  - Use `matched_employer_id` from database
  - Add trade capabilities to matched employer
  - Update employer with new data
  - Mark as imported
  - Check for `import_status === 'create_new'` to bypass duplicate detection

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Manual Matching
- Search for existing employers by name or ABN
- See similarity scores
- View EBA status
- Select match OR create new OR skip

### 2. Automatic Match Confirmation
- Confirm suggested matches
- Switch to manual search if incorrect
- Clear visibility of detected duplicates

### 3. Skip Functionality
- Hide employers from import list
- Toggle visibility with "Show skipped" checkbox
- Can skip from dialog or quick button

### 4. Delete with Confirmation
- Proper confirmation dialog (not browser alert)
- Shows employer name
- Cancel/Confirm options
- Removes from selected employers

### 5. Filter Controls
- **Show skipped**: Toggle visibility of skipped employers
- **Show processed**: Toggle visibility of imported employers
- Both filters work independently

## Workflow

### For Employers WITHOUT Automatic Match
1. User sees: [Manual Match] [Skip] [Delete]
2. Click "Manual Match" → Search dialog opens
3. Search finds similar employers with scores
4. User can: Select Match, Create New, or Skip

### For Employers WITH Automatic Match
1. User sees: [Confirm Match] [Different Match] [Create New] [Delete]
2. Click "Confirm Match" → Uses automatic detection
3. Click "Different Match" → Opens manual search
4. Click "Create New" → Bypasses duplicate check

### During Import
1. Manual matches (`import_status = 'matched'`):
   - Use `matched_employer_id`
   - Merge trade/role data into existing employer
   - Mark as imported

2. Create new confirmed (`import_status = 'create_new'`):
   - Bypass duplicate detection
   - Create new employer record

3. Skipped (`import_status = 'skipped'`):
   - Hidden from list (unless "Show skipped" is checked)
   - Not processed during import

## Database Schema

### pending_employers table
- `import_status`: `'pending'` | `'imported'` | `'skipped'` | `'error'` | `'matched'` | `'create_new'`
- `matched_employer_id`: UUID reference to employers table (nullable)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Manual Match: Search, select, create new, skip
- [ ] Automatic Match: Confirm, switch to manual
- [ ] Skip: Quick skip, skip from dialog, toggle visibility
- [ ] Delete: Confirmation dialog, cancel, delete
- [ ] Filter: Show skipped, show processed toggles
- [ ] Import: Manual matches processed correctly
- [ ] Import: Create new bypasses duplicate check
- [ ] UI: Conditional buttons appear correctly
- [ ] UI: Dialogs open and close properly
