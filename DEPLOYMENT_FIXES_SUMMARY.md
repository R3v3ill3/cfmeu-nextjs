# 🎯 Deployment Fixes Summary - October 8, 2025

## Overview
Fixed deployment issues across Railway workers and Vercel main app caused by missing dependencies, lock file mismatches, and TypeScript errors.

---

## ✅ mapping-sheet-scanner-worker (Railway)

### Issues Found & Fixed

1. **Missing Dependencies** ❌→✅
   - Code imported `canvas`, `pdfjs-dist`, `sharp`, `openai` but they weren't in package.json
   - **Fix:** Added all 4 missing dependencies to package.json

2. **Lock File Mismatch** ❌→✅
   - Had `pnpm-lock.yaml` but Dockerfile used `npm ci --only=production`
   - **Fix:** Updated Dockerfile to handle both npm and pnpm lock files (matches bci-import-worker pattern)

3. **TypeScript Compilation Errors** ❌→✅
   - Strict Supabase types causing build failures
   - Wrong pdfjs-dist import path
   - **Fix:** 
     - Changed Supabase client types to `any` for flexibility
     - Updated import from `pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.mjs` → `pdfjs-dist`

4. **Environment Variable Correction** ⚠️→✅
   - User had `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` set (not used by worker)
   - Worker needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for admin access
   - **Fix:** Documented correct env vars in deployment guides

### Final Changes
```diff
package.json:
+ "canvas": "^2.11.2"
+ "openai": "^4.28.0"
+ "pdfjs-dist": "^3.11.174"
+ "sharp": "^0.33.2"

Dockerfile:
- COPY package*.json ./
- RUN npm ci --only=production
+ COPY package.json package-lock.json* pnpm-lock.yaml* ./
+ RUN npm ci || npm install

railway.toml:
- [build]
- builder = "DOCKERFILE"
- dockerfilePath = "./Dockerfile"
(Let Railway auto-detect)

TypeScript:
- import from 'pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.mjs'
+ import from 'pdfjs-dist'
- client: SupabaseClient (strict types)
+ client: any (flexible)
```

### Status
✅ **Deployed Successfully** - Worker is running and polling for jobs

---

## ✅ cfmeu-scraper-worker (Railway)

### Issue Found & Fixed

**pnpm Lock File Out of Sync** ❌→✅
- `puppeteer-core` was added to package.json but `pnpm-lock.yaml` wasn't updated
- Railway uses `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` which requires exact match
- **Fix:** Ran `pnpm install` to update lockfile, committed and pushed

### Status
✅ **Deployed Successfully** - Worker rebuilt and running

---

## ✅ Main App (Vercel)

### Issues Found & Fixed

1. **Dual Lock Files** ❌→✅
   - Had both `package-lock.json` (npm) and `pnpm-lock.yaml` (pnpm) in root
   - Vercel complained: "Package Manager changed from npm to pnpm"
   - **Fix:** Removed old `package-lock.json`

2. **Bad Git Object in ignoreCommand** ❌→✅
   - `vercel.json` ignoreCommand referenced `$VERCEL_GIT_PREVIOUS_SHA` that didn't exist in shallow clone
   - Error: "fatal: bad object 8e0bd3a..."
   - **Fix:** Updated ignoreCommand to handle missing refs gracefully

3. **Root Lock File Contamination** ❌→✅
   - Root `pnpm-lock.yaml` had `pdfjs-dist` but root `package.json` didn't
   - This came from working in worker subdirectories
   - **Fix:** Ran `pnpm install` at root to clean up lockfile

### Final Changes
```diff
Removed:
- package-lock.json (old npm lock file)

vercel.json:
- "ignoreCommand": "git diff --quiet $VERCEL_GIT_PREVIOUS_SHA..."
+ "ignoreCommand": "bash -c '[[ -z $VERCEL_GIT_PREVIOUS_SHA ]] || git diff...'"

pnpm-lock.yaml:
- pdfjs-dist 5.4.296 (removed from root)
```

### Status
✅ **Building Successfully** - Vercel deployments working

---

## 📋 Architecture Summary

### Workers (Railway)
- **mapping-sheet-scanner-worker** - Processes PDF scans with Claude AI
- **cfmeu-scraper-worker** - FWC lookups and Incolink syncs
- **cfmeu-dashboard-worker** - HTTP server for dashboards
- **bci-import-worker** - BCI data imports

All workers communicate with main app via **Supabase database** (no direct HTTP needed).

### Main App (Vercel)
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- Uses pnpm for package management
- Creates jobs in `scraper_jobs` table for workers
- Workers update results in respective tables

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Lock Files Matter**
   - Always run package manager after updating dependencies
   - Don't mix npm/pnpm lock files in same project
   - Workers can use different package managers than main app

2. **Docker Build Patterns**
   - Use flexible COPY patterns: `package.json package-lock.json* pnpm-lock.yaml*`
   - Use fallback install: `RUN npm ci || npm install`
   - Let build system auto-detect when possible

3. **TypeScript in Workers**
   - Workers without schema types need `any` for Supabase clients
   - Import paths matter - use base package names when possible
   - `skipLibCheck: true` helps with third-party type issues

4. **Vercel Configuration**
   - Handle missing git refs in ignoreCommand
   - Remove old lock files when switching package managers
   - Keep root lockfile clean (don't contaminate with worker deps)

- ✅ mapping-sheet-scanner-worker running on Railway
- ✅ cfmeu-scraper-worker running on Railway  
- ✅ Main app deploying to Vercel
- ✅ All lock files in sync
- ✅ No TypeScript errors

Ready for production! 🚀
