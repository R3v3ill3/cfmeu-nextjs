### Sham Contracting Detection

**什么是Sham Contracting**
Sham contracting occurs when employers misclassify employees as independent contractors to avoid legal obligations like payroll tax, superannuation, workers' compensation, and leave entitlements.

**Detection and Impact:**
- **Hard Block**: Sham contracting flags prevent green ratings (maximum Yellow/Amber)
- **Required Evidence**: Detailed notes and documentation required for flags
- **Assessment Locations**: Can be flagged in compliance checks, subcontractor assessments, and expertise ratings
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of flags, evidence, and resolutions maintained

**Flagging Process:**
1. Identify evidence of sham contracting during assessments
2. Toggle "Evidence of Sham Contracting Detected" switch
3. Provide detailed notes explaining the evidence and circumstances
4. Include specific examples, dates, and supporting information
5. Submit assessment with sham contracting flag

**Resolution Process:**
1. Employer addresses sham contracting issues
2. Evidence provided showing correction of practices
3. Union verification that issues are resolved
4. Clearing reason documented in audit trail
5. Rating cap removed for future assessments
