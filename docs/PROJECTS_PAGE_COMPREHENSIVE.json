On Projects page, click the Patch filter dropdown\n2. Select one or more patches\n3. List filters to show only projects in selected patches\n4. Patch name shows on each project card\n5. Clear by clicking 'X' on patch filter\n\n**Special Cases:**\n- Projects without job sites won't appear in patch filters\n- Projects with multiple sites may appear in multiple patches\n- New projects auto-assign to patches based on address coordinates",
