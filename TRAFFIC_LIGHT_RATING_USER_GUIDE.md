## Executive Summary

### What is the Traffic Light Rating System?

The Traffic Light Rating System is a comprehensive assessment tool that helps organisers and union leadership evaluate employer compliance and relationship quality. The system uses a simple traffic light color scheme (Green, Amber, Yellow, Red) to provide an at-a-glance understanding of each employer's standing.

### Why Does It Exist?

The rating system serves several critical purposes:

- **Compliance Tracking**: Monitor employer adherence to Enterprise Bargaining Agreements (EBAs), CBUS contributions, Incolink payments, and other compliance requirements
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify employers that may require additional attention or intervention
- **Resource Allocation**: Help organisers prioritize their time and efforts based on employer ratings
- **Historical Tracking**: Maintain a record of employer performance over time
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Provide objective metrics to support organising strategies

### The Two-Track Approach

The system uses two complementary assessment tracks:

1. **Track 1: Project Data** - Quantitative assessments based on compliance data from specific construction projects
2. **Track 2: Organiser Expertise** - Qualitative assessments based on organisers' knowledge and experience with employers

These two tracks are combined to produce a final rating, ensuring that both objective data and field experience inform the assessment.

### Key Concepts

**Traffic Light Colors:**
- **Green**: Excellent compliance and relationship - no concerns
- **Yellow**: Good performance with minor areas for improvement
- **Amber**: Moderate concerns requiring attention
- **Red**: Significant compliance issues or poor relationship - requires immediate action

**4-Point Assessment Scale:**
- **1 (Good)**: Exceeds expectations
- **2 (Fair)**: Meets expectations
- **3 (Poor)**: Below expectations
- **4 (Terrible)**: Major concerns

## Understanding the Rating System

### Traffic Light Colors and Meanings

The traffic light rating provides a quick visual indicator of an employer's overall standing:

**Green Rating**
- Excellent compliance across all areas
- Strong relationship with the union
- No outstanding issues or concerns
- Reliable partner for ongoing work

**Yellow Rating**
- Good overall performance
- Minor areas that could be improved
- Generally compliant with requirements
- Maintains positive relationship with union

**Amber Rating**
- Moderate concerns requiring attention
- Some compliance issues present
- Relationship may need improvement
- Requires monitoring and follow-up

**Red Rating**
- Significant compliance problems
- Poor relationship with union
- May have outstanding disputes or issues
- Requires immediate intervention

**Unknown Rating**
- Insufficient data to determine rating
- No assessments completed yet
- New employer or limited interaction

### The 4-Point Assessment Scale

When completing assessments, you'll rate various criteria using a 4-point scale:

**1 - Good (Exceeds Expectations)**
- Performance is exceptional
- Goes above and beyond requirements
- Sets a positive example for others
- No concerns identified

**2 - Fair (Meets Expectations)**
- Performance is acceptable
- Meets standard requirements
- Generally compliant
- Minor improvements possible

**3 - Poor (Below Expectations)**
- Performance is concerning
- Does not consistently meet requirements
- Issues need to be addressed
- Requires improvement

**4 - Terrible (Major Concerns)**
- Serious problems identified
- Significant non-compliance
- Major relationship issues
- Requires immediate action

### How Scores Convert to Traffic Light Ratings

The system converts your 4-point assessment scores into traffic light ratings using a weighted calculation:

1. Individual criteria scores are collected from assessments
2. Each assessment type has a specific weight in the calculation
3. Scores are combined using the weighting system
4. The final numeric score is converted to a traffic light color:
   - Scores indicating excellent performance → Green
   - Scores indicating good performance → Yellow
   - Scores indicating moderate concerns → Amber
   - Scores indicating serious problems → Red

**Important**: Sham contracting detection creates a "hard block" that prevents green ratings. If an employer is flagged for sham contracting, their maximum possible rating is Yellow/Amber, regardless of other assessment scores.

### Confidence Levels

Each assessment includes a confidence level that indicates how certain you are about the rating:

**High Confidence**
- Based on direct, recent experience
- Multiple sources of information
- Clear evidence available
- Recent interaction (within 90 days)

**Medium Confidence**
- Based on reliable information
- Some direct experience
- Adequate evidence
- Recent interaction (within 120 days)

**Low Confidence**
- Based on limited information
- Indirect knowledge
- Minimal evidence
- Older information (over 120 days)

**Very Low Confidence**
- Based on very limited information
- Hearsay or second-hand knowledge
- Little to no evidence
- Very old information

Confidence levels affect how much weight your assessment carries in the final rating calculation. Higher confidence assessments have more influence on the final rating.

## The Two-Track Assessment System

The traffic light rating system uses two complementary assessment tracks that work together to provide a comprehensive view of each employer.

### Track 1: Project Data Assessments

**What It Measures:**
Track 1 collects quantitative compliance data from specific construction projects where the employer is working. This includes:

- CBUS payment compliance and timing
- Incolink payment compliance and timing
- Safety incident reporting
- Industrial disputes
- Payment issues
- Site visit reports
- Delegate reports
- EBA status verification

**How It's Collected:**
- Compliance checks completed during site visits
- Data entered in project compliance tabs
- Automated data from external systems (where available)
- Reports from delegates and workers

**When It's Used:**
Track 1 data is most valuable when:
- The employer is actively working on projects you can access
- You have recent site visit data
- Compliance checks have been completed
- Multiple projects provide a pattern of behavior

**Strengths:**
- Objective, measurable data
- Based on actual project performance
- Can show trends over time
- Provides specific evidence

**Limitations:**
- Only reflects performance on assessed projects
- May not capture overall employer behavior
- Requires active projects to generate data
- Can miss off-site issues

### Track 2: Organiser Expertise Assessments

**What It Measures:**
Track 2 captures organisers' qualitative knowledge and experience with employers, including:

- Overall relationship quality
- Historical performance patterns
- Industry reputation
- Communication effectiveness
- Problem-solving approach
- Union engagement level
- Knowledge beyond specific projects

**How It's Collected:**
- Organiser expertise wizard assessments
- Overall employer assessments
- Historical relationship tracking
- Industry knowledge and reputation

**When It's Used:**
Track 2 assessments are valuable when:
- You have extensive experience with the employer
- The employer works across multiple projects
- You have knowledge beyond specific project data
- Project data is limited or unavailable

**Strengths:**
- Captures broader employer behavior
- Includes historical context
- Reflects relationship quality
- Can identify patterns across projects

**Limitations:**
- Subjective by nature
- Depends on organiser experience
- May vary between organisers
- Requires organiser knowledge

### How the Two Tracks Are Combined

The system combines Track 1 and Track 2 assessments using a weighted calculation:

1. **Project Data Weight**: Typically 60-70% of the final rating
2. **Organiser Expertise Weight**: Typically 30-40% of the final rating
3. **EBA Status Influence**: EBA compliance status affects the final rating
4. **Sham Contracting Block**: If detected, caps the rating at Yellow/Amber

The exact weights can be customized based on:
- Available data quality
- Number of assessments
- Recency of assessments
- Organiser confidence levels

### Which Track Takes Priority?

**When Both Tracks Have Data:**
- The system combines both tracks using weighted averages
- More recent assessments carry more weight
- Higher confidence assessments have greater influence
- Project data typically has slightly more weight than expertise

**When Only One Track Has Data:**
- The system uses the available track
- The rating may have lower confidence
- Additional assessments are recommended

**When Tracks Conflict:**
- If project data suggests one rating but expertise suggests another, the system:
  - Applies weighted combination
  - Flags the discrepancy for review
  - May prioritize more recent or higher confidence data
  - Allows manual override if needed

**Special Cases:**
- **Sham Contracting**: Always caps rating at Yellow/Amber, regardless of other scores
- **No EBA**: Automatically results in Red rating
- **Expired EBA**: Caps rating at Amber

## Sham Contracting Detection

### What is Sham Contracting?

Sham contracting occurs when an employer misclassifies employees as independent contractors to avoid employment obligations such as:
- Payroll tax
- Superannuation contributions
- Workers' compensation
- Leave entitlements
- Union coverage under EBAs

This is illegal and harms workers by denying them proper entitlements and protections.

### How Sham Contracting Affects Ratings

**Hard Block to Green Ratings**

Sham contracting detection creates a "hard block" in the rating system. This means:

- **Maximum Rating**: Employers flagged for sham contracting can receive a maximum rating of **Yellow/Amber**
- **Automatic Cap**: Even if all other assessments would result in a Green rating, the presence of sham contracting flags automatically caps the rating
- **Persistent Effect**: The block remains in place until sham contracting flags are cleared
- **Clear Indication**: The rating display will show that the rating is capped due to sham contracting

**Why This Matters:**
- Protects workers from exploitation
- Ensures compliance with employment law
- Maintains integrity of the rating system
- Signals serious compliance issues

### Where Sham Contracting Can Be Flagged

You can flag sham contracting in three places:

**1. Employer Compliance Checks (Project-Specific)**
- When completing compliance checks for an employer on a specific project
- Located in the compliance check form
- Use this when you have evidence from a specific project

**2. Subcontractor Assessments**
- When completing a subcontractor use assessment
- Includes specific questions about subcontractor practices
- Use this when assessing subcontractor relationships

**3. Organiser Expertise Ratings**
- When completing an overall expertise assessment
- Use this when you have broader knowledge of sham contracting practices
- Applies to employer-wide assessment

### How to Flag Sham Contracting

**Step 1: Access the Assessment Form**
- Navigate to the relevant assessment (compliance check, subcontractor assessment, or expertise rating)

**Step 2: Locate the Sham Contracting Section**
- Look for the "Sham Contracting Detection" section
- This will be clearly labeled with a warning about the hard block effect

**Step 3: Toggle the Detection Switch**
- Turn on the "Evidence of Sham Contracting Detected" toggle
- This will reveal additional fields

**Step 4: Provide Required Notes**
- You **must** provide detailed notes explaining the evidence
- Be specific about what you observed
- Include dates, locations, and details
- Explain why this constitutes sham contracting

**Step 5: Submit the Assessment**
- Complete the rest of the assessment as normal
- Submit the form
- The sham contracting flag will be recorded

**Important Requirements:**
- **Notes are mandatory** - You cannot flag sham contracting without providing detailed notes
- **Be specific** - Vague descriptions are not sufficient
- **Provide evidence** - Describe what you saw, heard, or documented
- **Include context** - Explain the circumstances

### How to Clear Sham Contracting Flags

Sham contracting flags can be cleared when:
- The issue has been resolved
- Evidence shows the flag was incorrect
- The employer has taken corrective action

**Clearing Project-Specific Flags:**

1. Navigate to the project compliance check where the flag was set
2. Locate the "Clear Sham Contracting Flag" option
3. Provide a **clearing reason** explaining why the flag should be removed
4. Submit the clearance

**Clearing Employer-Wide Flags:**

1. Navigate to the employer's rating page
2. Access the sham contracting audit log
3. Select the flag(s) to clear
4. Provide a **clearing reason** for each flag
5. Submit the clearance

**Clearing Requirements:**
- **Reason is mandatory** - You must explain why the flag is being cleared
- **Documentation** - Provide evidence that the issue is resolved
- **Review** - The clearance will be logged in the audit trail

### How Sham Contracting Appears in Rating Displays

When an employer has active sham contracting flags:

**Rating Display:**
- The rating will show as Yellow or Amber (never Green)
- A warning indicator may appear
- The rating breakdown will note the sham contracting block

**Rating Details:**
- The rating calculation will show:
  - Original calculated rating (what it would be without the block)
  - Applied rating (capped due to sham contracting)
  - Reason for the cap
  - Number of active flags

**Audit Trail:**
- All sham contracting flags and clearances are logged
- You can view the complete history
- Each action includes who made it and when
- Notes and reasons are preserved

### Understanding the Audit Trail

The sham contracting audit trail provides a complete history:

**What's Recorded:**
- When sham contracting was first detected
- Who detected it
- What evidence was provided
- When flags were cleared (if applicable)
- Who cleared them
- Why they were cleared

**Accessing the Audit Trail:**
1. Navigate to the employer's page
2. Go to the Traffic Light Rating tab
3. Look for "Sham Contracting Audit Trail" section
4. Review the complete history

**Why This Matters:**

## Weighting System

### How Different Assessments Are Weighted

The rating system uses a weighting system to determine how much each assessment type contributes to the final rating. Different assessments have different weights because some factors are more critical than others.

**Default Weight Distribution:**

- **EBA Status**: 30% weight
  - Critical factor - no EBA means automatic Red rating
  - Expired EBA caps rating at Amber

- **Union Respect**: 25% weight
  - Important indicator of relationship quality
  - Affects ability to organise effectively

- **Safety**: 25% weight
  - Critical for worker welfare
  - Legal compliance requirement

- **Subcontractor Use**: 20% weight
  - Important for industry standards
  - Can indicate broader compliance issues

**Role-Specific Weightings:**
- Different employer roles may have adjusted weightings
- Head contractors may weight safety more heavily
- Subcontractors may weight union respect more heavily
- Labour hire may have different considerations

### Why Some Assessments Matter More Than Others

**EBA Status Has Highest Weight Because:**
- It's a legal requirement for many employers
- No EBA means workers lack basic protections
- It's a fundamental indicator of compliance
- It affects all other aspects of the relationship

**Union Respect Matters Because:**
- It affects your ability to organise effectively
- Poor respect indicates broader relationship issues
- It impacts worker engagement
- It's a predictor of future behavior

**Safety Is Critical Because:**
- Worker welfare is paramount
- Legal compliance requirement
- Safety issues can indicate broader problems
- Poor safety affects all workers

**Subcontractor Use Matters Because:**
- Can indicate compliance with industry standards
- May reveal broader business practices
- Affects subcontractor workers
- Can reveal sham contracting

### How Organiser Confidence Affects Ratings

Your confidence level in an assessment affects how much weight it carries:

**High Confidence Assessments:**
- Carry full weight in calculations
- Based on direct, recent experience
- Multiple sources of information
- Strong evidence available

**Medium Confidence Assessments:**
- Carry moderate weight (typically 80-90% of full weight)
- Based on reliable but limited information
- Some direct experience
- Adequate evidence

**Low Confidence Assessments:**
- Carry reduced weight (typically 60-70% of full weight)
- Based on limited information
- Indirect knowledge
- Minimal evidence

**Very Low Confidence Assessments:**
- Carry minimal weight (typically 40-50% of full weight)
- Based on very limited information
- Hearsay or second-hand knowledge
- Little to no evidence

**Confidence Multipliers:**
- Organisers with strong track records may have confidence multipliers applied
- This rewards accurate assessors
- Encourages careful, evidence-based assessments

### How Recent Assessments Are Weighted vs Older Ones

**Temporal Decay:**
- More recent assessments carry more weight
- Older assessments gradually lose influence
- Very old assessments (over 1 year) have minimal impact

**Recency Weighting:**
- **Within 90 days**: Full weight
- **90-180 days**: 80% weight
- **180-365 days**: 60% weight
- **Over 365 days**: 40% weight (minimum)

**Why This Matters:**
- Ensures ratings reflect current performance
- Accounts for changes in employer behavior
- Prevents stale data from dominating
- Encourages regular assessment updates

**Best Practice:**
- Update assessments at least every 90 days
- More frequent updates for employers with concerns
- Reassess after significant changes
- Document improvements or deteriorations

## Best Practices

Following these best practices will help ensure accurate, useful ratings that support effective organising work.

### When to Complete Project Assessments

**Complete assessments when:**

- **After Site Visits**: Complete compliance checks and assessments immediately after visiting a project
- **After Compliance Checks**: When you've verified CBUS, Incolink, or other compliance items
- **When Issues Arise**: If you identify problems during site visits or interactions
- **Regular Intervals**: Aim to assess each active project at least every 90 days
- **After Significant Changes**: When employer behavior or circumstances change significantly
- **Before Important Decisions**: When ratings will inform organising decisions

**Don't wait to assess:**
- Complete assessments while information is fresh
- Don't let multiple site visits accumulate without assessment
- Update assessments when you have new information
- Don't skip assessments because you're busy

### When to Complete Expertise Assessments

**Complete expertise assessments when:**

- **You Have Broad Knowledge**: When you have experience with an employer across multiple projects or over time
- **Project Data Is Limited**: When there isn't enough project-specific data for a reliable rating
- **Relationship Changes**: When the relationship quality changes significantly
- **New Information**: When you learn important information about an employer's reputation or practices
- **Periodic Reviews**: Conduct overall assessments at least every 6 months for active employers
- **Before Major Interactions**: When preparing for important meetings or negotiations

**Consider your knowledge:**
- Only assess if you have sufficient knowledge
- Don't guess or speculate
- Use "Very Low" confidence if information is limited
- Update assessments when your knowledge increases

### How Often to Update Assessments

**Recommended Frequency:**

- **Project Assessments**: Every 90 days for active projects
- **Expertise Assessments**: Every 6 months for active employers
- **After Significant Events**: Immediately after major incidents or changes
- **When Issues Resolve**: Update when problems are addressed
- **When New Information**: Update when you learn relevant information

**Factors Affecting Frequency:**

- **Employer Rating**: Lower-rated employers may need more frequent assessment
- **Active Projects**: More active projects mean more frequent updates needed
- **Relationship Quality**: Changing relationships require more frequent updates
- **Compliance Issues**: Employers with compliance issues need closer monitoring

**Don't Over-Assess:**
- Avoid creating duplicate assessments for the same period
- Update existing assessments rather than creating new ones unnecessarily
- Focus on meaningful changes, not minor fluctuations

### What Confidence Level to Use

**Use High Confidence when:**
- You have direct, recent interaction (within 90 days)
- Multiple sources confirm your assessment
- Strong evidence supports your ratings
- You have deep knowledge of the employer

**Use Medium Confidence when:**
- You have reliable information
- Some direct experience
- Adequate evidence available
- Recent interaction (within 120 days)

**Use Low Confidence when:**
- Information is limited
- Mostly indirect knowledge
- Minimal evidence
- Older information (over 120 days)

**Use Very Low Confidence when:**
- Very limited information
- Hearsay or second-hand knowledge
- Little to no evidence
- Very old information

**Be Honest:**
- Don't inflate confidence levels
- Lower confidence is better than false confidence
- The system accounts for confidence in calculations
- You can always update with higher confidence later

### When to Add Notes and Evidence

**Always add notes when:**

- **Rating 3 or 4**: Poor or terrible ratings require explanation
- **Flagging Issues**: Any time you identify problems
- **Sham Contracting**: Detailed notes are mandatory
- **Unusual Circumstances**: When context is important
- **Conflicting Information**: When different sources disagree
- **Improvements or Deteriorations**: When ratings change significantly

**Add evidence when:**

- **Serious Issues**: For ratings of 3 or 4
- **Sham Contracting**: Evidence is critical
- **Disputes**: When documenting problems
- **Compliance Violations**: When reporting non-compliance
- **Supporting Claims**: When making specific allegations

**Note Quality Guidelines:**

- **Be Specific**: Include dates, locations, people involved
- **Be Objective**: Stick to facts, avoid speculation
- **Be Complete**: Provide enough context to understand
- **Be Professional**: Use appropriate language
- **Be Actionable**: Note what should be done

**Evidence Guidelines:**

- **Relevant**: Only include evidence that supports your assessment
- **Clear**: Ensure evidence is understandable
- **Documented**: Properly label and describe evidence
- **Accessible**: Use formats others can access
- **Legitimate**: Only include appropriate, legal evidence

### Additional Best Practices

**Consistency:**
- Use consistent standards across assessments
- Apply the 4-point scale consistently
- Don't let personal relationships bias assessments
- Focus on objective factors

**Accuracy:**
- Base assessments on facts, not assumptions
- Verify information when possible
- Cross-check with other organisers when appropriate
- Update assessments when you learn new information

**Timeliness:**
- Complete assessments promptly
- Don't let information get stale
- Update when circumstances change
- Regular maintenance prevents backlog

**Collaboration:**
- Discuss assessments with team members
- Share information about employers
- Coordinate on major employers
- Learn from others' assessments

**Documentation:**
- Keep good notes
- Document important interactions
- Maintain evidence files
- Update records regularly

**Review and Learning:**
- Review your past assessments
- Learn from rating outcomes
- Adjust your approach based on results
- Seek feedback from colleagues
