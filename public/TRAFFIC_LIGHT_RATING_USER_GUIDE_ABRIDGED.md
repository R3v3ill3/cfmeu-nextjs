## Executive Summary

### What is the Traffic Light Rating System?

A comprehensive assessment tool that evaluates employer compliance and relationship quality using a traffic light color scheme (Green, Amber, Yellow, Red).

### Purpose

- Compliance tracking
- Risk assessment
- Resource allocation
- Historical tracking
- Data-driven decisions

### The Two-Track Approach

1. **Track 1: Project Data** - Quantitative assessments from specific construction projects
2. **Track 2: Organiser Expertise** - Qualitative assessments from organisers' knowledge and experience

### Key Concepts

**Traffic Light Colors:**
- **Green**: Excellent compliance and relationship
- **Yellow**: Good performance with minor areas for improvement
- **Amber**: Moderate concerns requiring attention
- **Red**: Significant compliance issues or poor relationship
- **Unknown**: Insufficient data

**4-Point Assessment Scale:**
- 1 - Good
- 2 - Fair
- 3 - Poor
- 4 - Terrible

---

## Understanding the Rating System

### Traffic Light Colors and Meanings

- **Green**: Excellent compliance, strong relationship, no concerns
- **Yellow**: Good performance, minor improvements possible
- **Amber**: Moderate concerns, requires attention
- **Red**: Significant problems, requires immediate action
- **Unknown**: Insufficient data

### The 4-Point Assessment Scale

- 1 - Good
- 2 - Fair
- 3 - Poor
- 4 - Terrible

### How Scores Convert to Traffic Light Ratings

1. Individual criteria scores collected from assessments
2. Each assessment type has specific weight
3. Scores combined using weighting system
4. Final numeric score converted to traffic light color

**Note**: Sham contracting detection creates a hard block preventing green ratings (maximum Yellow/Amber).

### Confidence Levels

- **High**: Direct, recent experience with strong evidence
- **Medium**: Reliable information with adequate evidence
- **Low**: Limited information with minimal evidence
- **Very Low**: Very limited information, hearsay

---

## The Two-Track Assessment System

### Track 1: Project Data Assessments

**What It Measures:**
- CBUS payment compliance and timing
- Incolink payment compliance and timing
- Safety incident reporting
- Industrial disputes
- Payment issues
- Site visit reports
- Delegate reports
- EBA status verification

**How It's Collected:**
- Compliance checks during site visits
- Data entered in project compliance tabs
- Automated data from external systems
- Reports from delegates and workers

**When It's Used:**
- Employer actively working on accessible projects
- Recent site visit data available
- Compliance checks completed
- Multiple projects provide pattern of behavior

### Track 2: Organiser Expertise Assessments

**What It Measures:**
- Overall relationship quality
- Historical performance patterns
- Industry reputation
- Communication effectiveness
- Problem-solving approach
- Union engagement level
- Knowledge beyond specific projects

**How It's Collected:**
- Organiser expertise wizard assessments
- Overall employer assessments
- Historical relationship tracking
- Industry knowledge and reputation

**When It's Used:**
- Extensive experience with employer
- Employer works across multiple projects
- Knowledge beyond specific project data
- Project data limited or unavailable

### How the Two Tracks Are Combined

1. Project Data Weight: Typically 60-70% of final rating
2. Organiser Expertise Weight: Typically 30-40% of final rating
3. EBA Status Influence: Affects final rating
4. Sham Contracting Block: If detected, caps rating at Yellow/Amber

### Which Track Takes Priority?

**When Both Tracks Have Data:**
- System combines both using weighted averages
- More recent assessments carry more weight
- Higher confidence assessments have greater influence

**When Only One Track Has Data:**
- System uses available track
- Rating may have lower confidence
- Additional assessments recommended

**When Tracks Conflict:**
- Applies weighted combination
- Flags discrepancy for review
- May prioritize more recent or higher confidence data
- Allows manual override if needed

**Special Cases:**
- **Sham Contracting**: Always caps rating at Yellow/Amber
- **No EBA**: Automatically results in Red rating
- **Expired EBA**: Caps rating at Amber
