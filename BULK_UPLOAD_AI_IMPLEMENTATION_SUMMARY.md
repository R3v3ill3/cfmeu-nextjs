# AI-Assisted Bulk Upload - Implementation Complete

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Search Infrastructure

1. **Database Migration** (`supabase/migrations/20251010030000_add_project_search.sql`)
   - Created `search_all_projects(text)` RPC function
   - Uses `SECURITY DEFINER` to bypass RLS restrictions
   - Searches by project name, address, number, and builder
   - Returns top 50 matches with smart ranking

2. **Search API** (`src/app/api/projects/search/route.ts`)
   - GET endpoint: `/api/projects/search?q={query}`
   - Minimum 2 characters to search
   - Calls RPC function to fetch results
   - Returns JSON array of matching projects

3. **Project Search Dialog** (`src/components/projects/ProjectSearchDialog.tsx`)
   - Beautiful search interface with debouncing (300ms)
   - Real-time search as user types
   - Shows project name, address, number, and builder
   - Smart ranking (exact matches first)
   - "Create as New Project" fallback button

### Phase 2: AI Analysis

4. **AI Analysis API** (`src/app/api/projects/batch-upload/analyze/route.ts`)
   - POST endpoint: `/api/projects/batch-upload/analyze`
   - Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet to analyze PDFs
   - Detects project boundaries automatically
   - Extracts project names from mapping sheets
   - Returns confidence scores (0.0-1.0)
   - Cost tracking (~$0.05-0.15 per 20-page PDF)

5. **Enhanced Bulk Upload Dialog** (`src/components/projects/BulkUploadDialog.tsx`)
   - **NEW: AI Toggle** - Users can enable/disable AI analysis
   - **NEW: AI Analysis Step** - Shows "Analyzing PDF with AI..." with loader
   - **NEW: Confidence Badges** - Color-coded confidence scores (green ≥85%, yellow ≥60%, red <60%)
   - **NEW: Project Search** - Click "Search for project..." to find existing projects
   - **NEW: Auto-fallback** - If AI fails, automatically uses 2-page segmentation
   - All existing functionality preserved

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### With AI (Default)

```
1. Upload PDF
   ↓
2. Toggle "AI-Assisted Detection" ON (default)
   ↓
3. Click "Analyze with AI" (Sparkles icon)
   ↓
4. AI analyzes PDF (~10-20 seconds)
   - Detects project boundaries
   - Extracts project names
   - Calculates confidence scores
   ↓
5. Review AI Results
   - See extracted project names with confidence badges
   - Adjust page boundaries if needed
   - For each project:
     ⚪ Create New Project (default)
     ⚪ Match to Existing
   ↓
6. For "Match to Existing":
   - Click "Search for project..."
   - Type to search (auto-suggests based on AI-extracted name)
   - Select matching project
   ↓
7. Click "Process Upload"
   ↓
8. View batch details and review each project
```

### Without AI (Manual)

```
1. Upload PDF
   ↓
2. Toggle "AI-Assisted Detection" OFF
   ↓
3. Click "Next: Define Projects"
   ↓
4. Auto-segmentation (2 pages per project)
   - Project 1: pages 1-2
   - Project 2: pages 3-4
   - etc.
   ↓
5. Manual review and search (same as step 5-8 above)
```

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### 1. Push Database Migration

```bash
npx supabase db push
```

This creates the `search_all_projects()` function.

### 2. Verify Environment Variable

Ensure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in `.env`:
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: AI-Assisted Detection

1. Navigate to `/projects`
2. Click "Bulk Upload" button
3. Upload a multi-project PDF (e.g., 4-page PDF with 2 projects)
4. Leave AI toggle ON
5. Click "Analyze with AI"
6. **Expected:**
   - Loading spinner for 10-20 seconds
   - Toast: "AI detected X projects (cost: $0.XX)"
   - Project definitions auto-filled with extracted names
   - Confidence badges showing 85-100% for clear projects

### Test 2: Project Search & Match

1. Continue from Test 1
2. For first project, select "Match to Existing Project"
3. Click "Search for project..."
4. **Expected:**
   - Dialog opens with search bar
   - Auto-filled with AI-extracted project name
   - Type to search
   - See results appear (debounced)
   - Click project to select
   - Dialog closes, project name appears in button

### Test 3: Manual Mode (AI Fallback)

1. Navigate to `/projects`
2. Click "Bulk Upload"
3. Upload a PDF
4. Toggle AI OFF
5. Click "Next: Define Projects"
6. **Expected:**
   - Immediate transition (no AI analysis)
   - Projects auto-segmented (2 pages each)
   - Names: "Project 1", "Project 2", etc.
   - No confidence badges

### Test 4: Search Without AI-Extracted Name

1. Continue from Test 3
2. Select "Match to Existing" for a project
3. Click "Search for project..."
4. **Expected:**
   - Dialog opens with empty search bar
   - Type project name manually
   - Results appear as you type
   - Can select or click "Create as New Project"

### Test 5: Complete End-to-End

1. Upload 6-page PDF (3 projects)
2. AI detects 3 projects with names
3. Match first to existing project
4. Leave second as "Create New"
5. Match third to existing project
6. Process upload
7. **Expected:**
   - All validations pass
   - PDF splits into 3 files
   - 3 scan records created
   - Batch status page shows all 3
   - Worker processes each independently

## 📊 Cost Analysis

### AI Analysis Costs

Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet pricing:
- Input: $3 per million tokens
- Output: $15 per million tokens

**Typical costs:**
- 10-page PDF: ~$0.05
- 20-page PDF: ~$0.10-0.15
- 40-page PDF: ~$0.25-0.35

**Cost shown in toast after analysis:**
```
"AI detected 5 projects (cost: $0.12)"
```

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### Confidence Badges

- **Green (≥85%)**: "95% confident" - High confidence, likely accurate
- **Yellow (≥60%)**: "75% confident" - Medium confidence, review recommended
- **Red (<60%)**: "45% confident" - Low confidence, check carefully

### Icons Used

- 🧠 **Brain** - AI toggle section
- ✨ **Sparkles** - AI analysis button & indicators
- 🔍 **Search** - Project search buttons
- 📄 **FileText** - PDF indicators
- ✓ **CheckCircle** - Success states
- ⚠️ **AlertCircle** - Warnings/errors

## 🐛 Error Handling

### AI Analysis Failures

**Scenario:** Claude API error, timeout, or invalid response

**Behavior:**
1. Toast error: "AI analysis failed. Using manual mode."
2. Automatic fallback to 2-page segmentation
3. User can still proceed with manual definitions

### Search API Failures

**Scenario:** Database error or RLS issue

**Behavior:**
1. Empty results returned
2. User sees "No matching projects found"
3. Can click "Create as New Project"

### Validation Errors

- Overlapping page ranges → Toast error
- Invalid page numbers → Toast error
- Missing project selection for "Match" mode → Toast error
