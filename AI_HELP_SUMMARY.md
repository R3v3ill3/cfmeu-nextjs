# AI-Powered Help System - Executive Summary

## üìã What We're Building

An AI chatbot that provides **accurate, context-aware help** for the CFMEU Organiser Platform **without hallucinating** information about features or functionality.

## ‚úÖ Solution Overview

### Architecture: RAG-Based AI with Railway Worker

```
User ‚Üí Help Dialog ‚Üí Next.js API ‚Üí Railway Worker ‚Üí Vector DB + AI ‚Üí Grounded Response
```

**Key Innovation: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- AI only answers based on retrieved documentation
- No guessing or inventing features
- All responses cite source documents
- Confidence scoring prevents low-quality answers

### Technology Stack

| Component | Recommended | Alternative | Cost |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|------|
| **AI Provider** | Google Gemini Pro | OpenAI GPT-4 | $1.50/mo vs $7.50/mo |
| **Vector DB** | ChromaDB (self-hosted) | Pinecone (managed) | Free vs $70/mo |
| **Worker Runtime** | Node.js + Fastify | - | Included in Railway |
| **Embeddings** | Gemini (free) | OpenAI ($0.00002/1K) | Free vs ~$2.50 one-time |

**Total Monthly Cost: $10-20** (Gemini + ChromaDB + Railway worker)

## üéØ Why a Railway Worker?

Per your existing architecture preference [[memory:9218171]]:

‚úÖ **API keys stay server-side** (not in Next.js NEXT_PUBLIC_* env vars)  
‚úÖ **Consistent with existing workers** (cfmeu-scraper-worker, cfmeu-dashboard-worker, bci-import-worker)  
‚úÖ **Independent scaling** from Next.js app  
‚úÖ **Cost control** via caching and rate limiting  
‚úÖ **Resource isolation** - AI processing doesn't impact web performance  

## üõ°Ô∏è Hallucination Prevention Strategy

### 1. RAG Pipeline
```typescript
// ONLY use retrieved documentation - never general knowledge
const relevantDocs = await vectorDB.query(questionEmbedding, topK: 5)
const aiPrompt = `Answer ONLY based on these docs: ${relevantDocs}`
```

### 2. Strict System Prompt
```
CRITICAL RULES:
- ONLY answer based on provided documentation
- If not in docs, say "I don't have that information"
- Never make assumptions or invent features
- Always cite sources
```

### 3. Low Temperature (0.1)
Deterministic, factual responses - no creativity

### 4. Confidence Threshold
```typescript
if (confidence < 0.6) {
  return "I don't have enough information to answer that accurately."
}
```

### 5. Response Caching
Same question = same answer (consistency)

### 6. Feedback Loop
- Track thumbs up/down
- Monitor low-confidence responses
- Weekly documentation updates

## üìä Current State Analysis
