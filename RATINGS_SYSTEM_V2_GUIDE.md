## Executive Summary

### What is the Ratings System v2?

The Ratings System v2 is an advanced employer assessment framework that combines quantitative project data analysis with qualitative organiser expertise to generate comprehensive traffic light ratings. This system provides a more accurate, evidence-based approach to evaluating employer compliance and relationship quality through a sophisticated two-track methodology.

### Why Was It Developed?

Ratings System v2 addresses key limitations of simpler rating approaches by:

- **Combining Multiple Data Sources**: Integrates both objective project data and subjective organiser expertise
- **Weighted Assessment Methodology**: Uses evidence-based weighting to reflect the relative importance of different factors
- **Confidence Scoring**: Incorporates confidence levels to ensure ratings reflect data quality
- **Sham Contracting Protection**: Includes hard blocks to prevent green ratings for non-compliant employers
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for field use by construction site organisers

### The Two-Track Innovation

### How Tracks Combine for Final Rating

**Weighted Combination Formula:**
```
Final Score = (Track 1 Score × 0.70) + (Track 2 Score × 0.30)
```

**Confidence Adjustment:**
- High Confidence: Full weight applied
- Medium Confidence: 85% weight applied
- Low Confidence: 70% weight applied
- Very Low Confidence: 55% weight applied

**Recency Adjustment:**
- Within 90 days: Full weight
- 90-180 days: 85% weight
- 180-365 days: 70% weight
- Over 365 days: 55% weight

**Special Considerations:**
- **EBA Status Override**: No EBA = automatic Red rating
- **Sham Contracting Block**: Caps maximum rating at Yellow/Amber
- **Minimum Data Requirements**: Requires minimum assessments for reliable rating
- **Conflict Resolution**: System flags significant discrepancies between tracks

### Track Selection Guidelines

**Use Track 1 Primarily When:**
- Employer has active projects with accessible data
- Recent compliance checks have been completed
- Multiple projects provide pattern data
- Objective verification is available

**Use Track 2 Primarily When:**
- Limited project data available
- Employer has long relationship history
- Assessor has deep industry knowledge
- Project data doesn't tell full story

**Best Results Achieved When:**
- Both tracks have substantial data
- Assessments are recent and confident
- Tracks show consistent patterns
- Evidence supports both approaches

## Sham Contracting Detection

Sham contracting detection is a critical compliance feature that protects workers from exploitation and ensures rating integrity through systematic identification and tracking of potential sham arrangements.

### Understanding Sham Contracting

**What is Sham Contracting?**
Sham contracting occurs when an employer deliberately misclassifies employees as independent contractors to avoid legal obligations and costs. This practice:

- **Avoids Employment Obligations**: Superannuation, leave entitlements, workers' compensation
- **Evades Union Coverage**: Bypasses EBA requirements and union representation
- **Reduces Labor Costs**: Shifts costs to workers through misclassification
- **Undermines Industry Standards**: Creates unfair competition with compliant employers

**Common Sham Contracting Patterns:**
- Workers classified as contractors but treated like employees
- No genuine business independence or risk
- Fixed long-term arrangements resembling employment
- Workers providing tools and equipment without compensation
- Substantial employer control over work conditions

### Detection Methodology

**Automated Detection Triggers:**
- **ABN Analysis**: Workers providing personal ABNs for extended periods
- **Payment Patterns**: Regular weekly payments to "contractors"
- **Duration Analysis**: Same "contractors" working for extended periods
- **Work Pattern Analysis**: Workers working exclusively for one employer
- **Tool/Equipment Requirements**: Workers required to provide significant equipment

**Manual Detection Indicators:**
- **Site Observations**: Workers identified as contractors but showing employment characteristics
- **Interview Evidence**: Workers reporting employment-like conditions
- **Contract Review**: Analysis of contractor agreements showing employment characteristics
- **Payroll Analysis**: Inconsistent contractor payment patterns
- **Industry Intelligence**: Reports from other subcontractors or workers

**Detection Questions for Assessors:**
1. Are workers classified as contractors but working full-time?
2. Do workers have genuine business independence?
3. Are contractors providing significant tools/equipment?
4. Do contractors work for multiple employers?
5. Are payment arrangements consistent with contracting?
