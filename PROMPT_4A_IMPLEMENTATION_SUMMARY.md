# Prompt 4A Implementation Summary
## Migration & Testing Runbook

**Implementation Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully created a comprehensive deployment runbook for the Employer Alias Initiative covering all aspects of deploying Prompts 3B, 3C, and 3D to staging and production environments.

## Deliverable

**Main Document:** `docs/ALIAS_INITIATIVE_DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md` (21,000+ words)

A complete, production-ready deployment guide that any DevOps engineer or technical lead can follow to deploy the Alias Initiative safely and successfully.

## Document Structure

### 1. Pre-Deployment Checklist
**What:** Comprehensive readiness verification  
**Includes:**
- Code readiness (lint, tests, build, TypeScript)
- Database readiness (migrations, syntax, conflicts)
- Environment readiness (staging, backups, connections, monitoring)
- Team readiness (scheduling, notifications, rollback review)

### 2. Migration Order
**What:** Exact sequence for applying 3 migrations  
**Covers:**
1. Prerequisite checks (provenance schema, normalization function)
2. Canonical Promotion System (`20251015120000`)
3. Alias Search System (`20251015125000`)
4. Analytics System (`20251015130000`)
5. Dependency mapping between migrations

### 3. Staging Deployment (8 Steps)
**What:** Complete staging deployment procedure  
**Steps:**
1. Pre-deployment verification (git, migrations, backups)
2. Database backup (Supabase verification)
3. Run migrations (`supabase db push`)
4. Verify database objects (tables, views, functions)
5. Deploy application code (Vercel)
6. **Staging verification tests** (5 comprehensive tests)
7. Performance verification (query timing, index usage)
8. Staging sign-off checklist

**Verification Tests:**
- Test 1: Canonical Promotion Console Access
- Test 2: Alias Search API
- Test 3: Analytics Dashboard
- Test 4: BCI Import Flow
- Test 5: Pending Employers Resolution

### 4. Production Deployment (9 Steps)
**What:** Production deployment with safety measures  
**Steps:**
1. Pre-deployment database backup (verified)
2. Announce maintenance window (optional)
3. Run production migrations (with critical safeguards)
4. Verify database objects
5. Deploy application code
6. **Smoke tests** (3 critical tests)
7. **Monitor for 30 minutes** post-deployment
8. Post-deployment verification (1 hour after)
9. Production sign-off checklist

**Safety Features:**
- Multiple "STOP IMMEDIATELY" warnings
- Verification prompts before critical actions
- 30-minute monitoring window requirement
- Documented sign-off process

### 5. Rollback Procedures
**What:** Three-tiered rollback strategy  
**Options:**

**Application Rollback (Quick):**
```bash
vercel rollback  # ~2 minutes
```
Safe because: New DB objects are backward compatible

**Database Rollback (Complex):**
- Option 1: Disable New Features (Safest) - Revoke permissions
- Option 2: Drop New Objects (Risky) - Full removal with safeguards
- Option 3: Emergency Disable (Fastest) - Rename functions

**Rollback Decision Tree:**
```
Critical Issue → ROLLBACK IMMEDIATELY
High Impact → Evaluate → Rollback if affects all users
Medium/Low → Document, plan hotfix, no rollback
```

### 6. Backfill Strategy
**What:** Data backfill procedures for existing records  
**Covers:**
1. Existing Aliases - Already handled by migration
2. Missing Aliases for External IDs - SQL scripts provided
3. Normalizing Existing Aliases - Optional update queries

**Includes:** Risk assessment, timing estimates, rollback procedures for each

### 7. Monitoring & Validation
**What:** Comprehensive monitoring procedures  
**Includes:**

**Key Metrics Queries:**
- Database performance (query times, index usage, table sizes)
- Application metrics (API response times, error rates)
- Business metrics (daily alias creation, canonical decisions, coverage trends)

**Alerting Thresholds:**
- Query time > 1s for alias searches
- Error rate > 1% on `/api/employers`
- Canonical review backlog > 50
- Alias insert failures > 5/hour
- Coverage percentage drops > 5%

**Daily Health Checks:**
- SQL queries to run daily for first week
- Metrics to track: aliases created, decisions made, pending reviews, search performance

### 8. Troubleshooting
**What:** Solutions for common deployment issues  
**Covers:**

**5 Common Issues:**
1. "Relation already exists" - Partial migration recovery
2. "Function does not exist" - Dependency resolution
3. Slow alias search queries - Index optimization
4. Dashboard shows no data - View refresh and permissions
5. CSV export fails - Permission and format debugging

Each issue includes:
- Cause identification
- Step-by-step solution
- SQL commands to fix
- Verification steps

### 9. Success Criteria
**What:** 15-point checklist for deployment validation  
**Includes:**
- Technical criteria (migrations, objects, deployment)
- Functional criteria (features accessible, working correctly)
- Performance criteria (queries < 500ms, no degradation)
- Operational criteria (no errors, monitoring active, no issues reported)

### 10. Appendices
**What:** Reference information  

**Includes:**
- **Appendix A:** Migration file reference (sizes, objects)
- **Appendix B:** Database object reference (all tables, views, functions)
- **Appendix C:** API endpoint reference (methods, auth, purpose)
- **Appendix D:** Useful SQL queries (20+ ready-to-run queries)
