## Database Impact

### Table: `employers`

New records created with the following structure:
```typescript
{
  id: uuid (auto-generated),
  name: string (required),
  employer_type: enum (required),
  abn?: string,
  website?: string,
  email?: string,
  phone?: string,
  estimated_worker_count?: integer,
  notes?: string,
  created_at: timestamp (auto),
  updated_at: timestamp (auto)
}
```

## User Experience Flow

1. User clicks "Add Employer" button
2. Dialog opens with clean, organized form
3. User fills in required fields (name, type)
4. User optionally fills in additional fields (contact info, estimates, notes)
5. User clicks "Create Employer"
6. System validates input
7. System creates employer record
8. Success notification appears
9. Dialog closes
10. Employer list refreshes automatically
11. Detail modal opens for the new employer (allows immediate editing/viewing)

## Benefits

1. **Quick Access**: Users can add employers without leaving the Employers page
2. **Comprehensive Data Entry**: All relevant fields available at creation time
3. **Immediate Verification**: Detail modal opens after creation for verification
4. **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile
5. **User-Friendly**: Clear validation, loading states, and success feedback
6. **Efficient Workflow**: Auto-refresh means no manual page reload needed

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for consideration:
1. ABN validation and auto-lookup using ABR API
2. Duplicate detection before creation (name/ABN matching)
3. Bulk import option from CSV
4. Template selection for common employer types
5. Auto-suggestion based on partially entered names
6. Integration with external business registries
