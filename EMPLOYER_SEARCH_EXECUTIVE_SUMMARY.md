# Employer Search Performance: Executive Summary

## The Problem

Your Employers page search for "zenith" with `engaged=true` is slow and generates console warnings. Users experience:
- **700-1800ms query times** (should be <300ms)
- Slow, clunky interface
- Poor user experience

## Root Cause (Simple Explanation)

The system is doing the work in the **wrong place**:

```
❌ CURRENT (Slow):
1. Database: "Give me ALL employers with 'zenith' in name" → 100 employers
2. API: Load all relationships for all 100 employers
3. JavaScript: Filter down to 10 engaged employers
4. User: Receives 10 employers after 1500ms

✅ OPTIMAL (Fast):
1. Database: "Give me engaged employers with 'zenith'" → 10 employers
2. API: Return immediately
3. User: Receives 10 employers after 200ms
```

**Key Issues:**
1. **Post-filtering** (filtering after database query in JavaScript)
2. **Over-fetching** (loading data that gets filtered away)
3. **Missing indexes** (database can't optimize queries)
4. **Complex relationships** (projects, organisers) fetched separately

## Impact

### Current Performance
| Search Type | Current | Should Be |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| Simple name search | 200-500ms | 50-100ms |
| Search + filters | 700-1200ms | 100-200ms |
| With enhanced data | 1200-1800ms | 200-400ms |

### Business Impact
- **Poor UX**: Users wait 1-2 seconds per search
- **Scalability**: Will get worse as employer count grows
- **Resource waste**: Server doing unnecessary work
- **User frustration**: Slow = looks broken

## Solution Options (Ranked)

### 🥇 Option 1: Materialized View (RECOMMENDED)
**What:** Precompute all filters in database, refresh every 5 minutes

**Performance:** 80-90% faster (1500ms → 200ms)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Not as fast as other options
- ❌ Partial solution
- ❌ May need more work later

---

### Option 4: Full-Text Search (Supplement Only)
**What:** Add fuzzy search for typos, better matching

**Performance:** 20-30% faster for search quality
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Risk:** Low

**Pros:**
- ✅ Handles typos better
- ✅ Better search experience

**Cons:**
- ❌ Doesn't solve core filtering problem
- ❌ Must combine with other options

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1)
**Implement:** Option 3 (Hybrid) + Missing Indexes
**Result:** 30-40% faster immediately
**Risk:** Very low

```sql
-- Add these indexes:
CREATE INDEX idx_employers_type ON employers(employer_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_employers_name_pattern ON employers(name text_pattern_ops);

-- Move engagement filter to database
-- (Simple query change in API)
```

**Code changes:** Minimal (~100 lines in API route)

---

### Phase 2: Long-term Solution (Weeks 2-3)
**Implement:** Option 1 (Materialized View)
**Result:** 80-90% faster overall
**Risk:** Low (tested approach)

```sql
-- Create precomputed view with all filters
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW employers_search_optimized AS
SELECT 
  e.*,
  (engagement check) as is_engaged,
  (EBA category logic) as eba_category,
  (precompute relationships) as projects_json,
  ...
FROM employers e;

-- Refresh every 5 minutes
```

**Code changes:** ~50 lines (just change table name in queries)

---

### Phase 3: Polish (Week 4)
**Implement:** Option 4 (Full-Text Search)
**Result:** Better search quality + typo handling
**Risk:** Very low

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;
CREATE INDEX idx_employers_name_trgm ON employers USING gin(name gin_trgm_ops);
```

## Timelines & Costs

| Phase | Duration | Developer Days | Performance Gain | Risk |
|-------|----------|----------------|------------------|------|
| Phase 1 (Quick Win) | 1-2 days | 1 day | +30-40% | Low |
| Phase 2 (Mat View) | 1-2 weeks | 3-4 days | +80-90% | Low |
| Phase 3 (Full-Text) | 2-3 days | 1 day | +Search Quality | Low |
| **TOTAL** | **3 weeks** | **5-6 days** | **~85% faster** | **Low** |

## Why This Matters

### Current State: 1500ms average
- ❌ Users feel the delay
- ❌ Looks like something is broken
- ❌ Frustrating experience
- ❌ Won't scale to 10,000+ employers

### After Phase 1: 900ms average (30-40% faster)
- ⚠️ Better but still slow
- ⚠️ Users notice improvement
- ✅ Low risk, quick to implement

### After Phase 2: 200ms average (85% faster)
- ✅ Instant response
- ✅ Professional user experience
- ✅ Scales to 100,000+ employers
- ✅ Future-proof solution

## Data Freshness Trade-off

**Question:** Is 5-minute data delay acceptable?

**Context:**
- Employers page is used for **searching and browsing**
- Not real-time data entry
- EBA status changes slowly (days/weeks)
- Engagement status changes slowly (when workers/projects are added)

**Similar to:**
- Google search results (updated periodically, not real-time)
- Analytics dashboards (5-15 min refresh is standard)
- LinkedIn search (not real-time)

**Recommendation:** ✅ 5-minute delay is acceptable for this use case

**If real-time is critical:** Use Option 2 (Database Function) instead, but accept 60-70% improvement instead of 80-90%

## Testing Plan

### Before Implementation
```bash
# Measure baseline
curl https://your-app/api/employers?q=zenith&engaged=true
# Record: 1500ms average
```

### After Phase 1
```bash
# Should be ~900ms (30-40% faster)
# Low risk, quick verification
```

### After Phase 2
```bash
# Should be ~200ms (85% faster)
# Load test: 10 concurrent users, 50 searches/min
# All searches should be <300ms
```

A: Materialized view solution scales easily. Just refresh more frequently.

**Q: Can we test before deploying?**
A: Yes, all changes can be tested in development/staging first.

**Q: What if something goes wrong?**
A: Easy rollback - just switch table name back or use feature flag.

**Q: Do we sacrifice search comprehensiveness?**
A: No! All solutions maintain full dataset searchability.
